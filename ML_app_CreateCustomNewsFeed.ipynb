    "# ML App to Create a Custom Newsfeed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is an excellent way to fill in any knowledge gap. It is even better if there is a way to enchance this experience whereby to quickly get a customised newsfeed tailored to the reader's interests. This project/app aims to help frequent readers such as myself to find even more to read or rather, to satisfy curiousities on certain topics. It can be seen as beneficial to have what you want to read without going through the hassle of digging for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully by the end of this project, a system can be built that is able to understand a tailored taste in news and be able to send them directly to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breakdown of the Project:\n",
    "- Making a supervised training set with the Pocket App.\n",
    "- Utilising the Pocket API to obtain stories.\n",
    "- Making use of the Embedly API to extract story bodies.\n",
    "- Basics of NLP (Natural Language Processing)\n",
    "- Classifiers such as SVM (Support Vector Machines)\n",
    "- IFTTT will be integrated with RSS feeds and Google Sheets.\n",
    "- Setup a system for a daily personal newsletters"

    "## Installing Pocket Chrome Extension for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pocket app/extension allows for saving personalised stories to be read later on. The stories can be linked to tags, and these tags can be different to every user. From this, the idea is to use to to tag 'y' for interesting topics while 'n' for non-interesting topics. Usage of the Pocket app/extension to help create a __supervised training__ set for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup and example of usage:\n",
    "1. Open Chrome, and add Pocket app in the Extensions.\n",
    "2. Open any link of interest.\n",
    "3. Click on the Pocket extension icon, once red, it means the article or link have been saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin constructing the supervised dataset:\n",
    "1. As you go through your day, read your articles.\n",
    "2. Tag 'y' for interesting ones, and tag 'n' for non-interesting ones.\n",
    "3. Note: it is better to have lots (100s) of articles to make the model better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrive the save stories:\n",
    "1. Go to: https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new\n",
    "2. Click on 'Create a New App' in the top left corner of the webpage.\n",
    "3. Input the details and get the API KEY.\n",
    "4. Be sure to click on all the Permissions (allows for adding, changing and retrieving)\n",
    "5. Once done, click to submit.\n",
    "6. Click on 'My Apps' in the top left corner fo the webpage and you will see the custom applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these, move on to the next stage which is the code below."

I think it could be a great long term option due to the rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) market which is driving increasingly strong demand for its key Altium Designer product. Also supporting its growth are its other businesses such as the Octopart search engine business.\\nAppen Ltd\\xa0(ASX: APX)\\nAnother of my favourite growth shares is Appen. It is a leading developer of high-quality, human annotated datasets for the machine learning and artificial intelligence markets. As with the IoT market, these markets are expected to grow at a rapid rate over the next decade. Given its leadership position in these markets, I expect demand for its services to continue to grow in the coming years and underpin strong earnings growth.\\nWebjet Limited\\xa0(ASX: WEB)\\nThis online travel agent has fallen heavily in recent weeks amid concerns over the impact of the coronavirus on the travel industry and a bearish broker note out of Morgan Stanley. That broker note claims that the Google Flights business is disrupting Webjet’s consumer business. Whilst the coronavirus could weigh on its performance slightly in the current quarter, the Google threat appears to have been overplayed. In fact, management has hit back at the broker note and dismissed its claims. In light of this, I believe the recent share price weakness could be a buying opportunity for investors.

More than 80 per cent were over 60 years old, and more than 75 per cent had an underlying disease, Jiao Yahui, a National Health Commission official, told a news conference.\\nDr David Heymann, who led the World Health Organisation\\'s response to the SARS outbreak, said it\\'s too early to tell when the new virus will peak, but that it appears to still be on the increase.\\nHe said the spike in China\\'s caseload in recent days is partly attributable to the search being expanded to include milder cases, not only people with pneumonia. He declined to predict whether the virus would ultimately cause a pandemic, or worldwide outbreak. WHO defines a pandemic as sustained transmission of a disease in at least two world regions.\\nHeymann said as the new virus starts to spread beyond China, scientists will gain a better understanding of it. \"What we will see is the clearer natural history of the disease,\" he said, as those exposed to the virus \"are being traced and watched very closely,\" he said.\\nNevertheless, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries outside China to share more data on infections, saying detailed information has been provided in only 38 per cent of cases.\\nIn particular, he said, \"some high-income countries are well behind in sharing this vital data with WHO. ...

He said he was taken from his home and questioned by police after he posted a video of what he saw online.\\nThailand confirmed six more cases on Tuesday, raising its total to 25, the highest outside China.

       " \"A trickle of boron powder could turn nuclear fusion dreams into reality.\\nTokamak reactors are one of the major frontiers in fusion research , but they're also volatile—and potentially dangerous.\\nInert boron powder would replace explosive boron-hydrogen gas.\\nResearchers at Princeton University have found a way to make a tokamak nuclear fusion reactor safer using insulating boron powder. The new research appears in the IAEA journal Nuclear Fusion and comes from Princeton’s U.S. Department of Energy-funded Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).\\nA tokamak, like the huge one that will reach 200 million Celsius in China next year, is a nuclear fusion plasma reactor where extremely hot, charged plasma spins and generates virtually limitless energy. The Princeton research examines the way boron powder can prevent one of the fundamental flaws in existing plasma reactor technology.\\nRelated Story\\nChina Is Building an Artificial Sun\\nPlasma is volatile, and particles that escape the sun-hot plasma stream react with the materials that enclose the tokamak. This stops the plasma fusion reaction because the temperature falls out of the effective zone, but more importantly in Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s also wildly dangerous for the reactor itself and everything around it.\\nThe PPPL team found that while boriding—literally, coating with boron—helps to keep plasma in the right reaction state, the existing method is too dangerous. Nuclear scientists use diborane gas, which is made of boron and explosively flammable hydrogen. To use it, these scientists must stop their tokamaks completely, introduce the gas, then leave again because of the flammability. At PPPL, they thought there must be a better way.\\nTo make the process just as effective, but far safer, the PPPL team tested the use of both pure boron and boron nitride powders. The powders are inert, meaning they don’t react with anything or catch fire. The researchers applied the powders by injecting them into the tokamak while it was running, which is another method improvement over diborane gas. Once inside, the powder worked the same way the gas did: It kept the temperature in the high performance zone, which keeps the plasma more stable and prevents scraping the sides of the tokamak’s chamber.\\nLike This? You'll Love These\\nEverything You Need to Know About the Sun\\nThe use of powder can also help scientists develop simpler, safer forms of plasma reactions called low-density plasmas. These plasmas can be controlled more safely and could be a more immediately practical form of reactor for use in the energy sector. Heck, when plasma reaction is considered pretty dangerous and experimental, having any options at all is a way to bring more researchers into the fray and open the field up to new ideas.\\nAnd since scientists can just dribble in more powder as they need it, the PPPL team believes its research has big ramifications for use of classic fusion reactors, too, where continuous uptime is vital to any version that could be used in the long term. Lead scientist Dr. Robert Lunsford said in a Princeton press release , “This is one way to get to a steady-state fusion machine.” In other words, this is a step toward the energy holy grail.\\nThe Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory is a government-sponsored national laboratory, in the same category as Argonne, Fermi, and Los Alamos. The U.S. Department of Energy funds and boosts these labs not as the farm team for professional science, but as the major place where innovation takes place in the U.S. If a practical fusion reactor came from one of these labs, that would be proof of concept indeed.\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\",\n",
       " 'A lightbulb moment for nuclear fusion?\\nNuclear power\\nA lightbulb moment for nuclear fusion?\\nBoris Johnson’s gung-ho claims may be wide of the mark, but scientists pursuing the holy grail of energy generation are taking giant steps\\nSun 27 Oct 2019 04.00\\xa0EDT\\nLast modified on Thu 31 Oct 2019 07.36\\xa0EDT\\nShare via Email\\nAn artist’s rendering of the reaction vessel at Iter in the south of France. Photograph: David Parker/Science Photo Library\\n“They are on the verge of creating commercially viable miniature fusion reactors for sale around the world,” Boris Johnson told the Conservative party conference earlier this month – “they” apparently being UK scientists. It was, at best, a rash promise for how nuclear fusion might make the UK carbon-neutral by the middle of the century – the target recommended by the Committee on Climate Change , which advises the government. “I know they have been on the verge for some time,” Johnson hedged. “It is a pretty spacious kind of verge.” But now, he assured his audience, “we are on the verge of the verge”.\\nIt’s a familiar and bitter joke about nuclear fusion as an energy source that, ever since it was first mooted in the 1950s, it has been 30 years away. Johnson’s comments had the extra irony that Brexit could merely add to that distance.\\nIt’s not clear what “commercially viable miniature fusion reactors” the prime minister had in mind. There are no such things either existing or planned at the main centre for fusion research in the UK, the Joint European Torus (Jet) at Culham in Oxfordshire, which Johnson visited in August. Experiments at Jet, conducted by all partners within the 28-state Eurofusion consortium, aim to make the nuclear fusion of hydrogen – the process that powers the sun and other stars – viable for energy generation by collecting the heat released to drive turbines for electricity. When Jet is running, the temperature inside is more than 100m C, making it “the hottest place in the solar system” according to CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Ian Chapman.\\nNuclear fusion is the merging of atoms. Every atom contains a very dense central blob called the nucleus, made up of particles called protons and neutrons. Atoms of different chemical elements have nuclei with different numbers of protons. If two nuclei collide at high enough energy, they can amalgamate to form a different, heavier element. It requires very high temperatures and densities: inside the sun, temperatures of 10m C or so enable hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium. This process releases energy, which makes the sun shine.\\nToday’s nuclear power plants use not fusion but nuclear fission: the splitting apart of heavy nuclei. This happens spontaneously for radioactive elements such as uranium, and it too releases energy. But both the fuel and the products may remain highly radioactive for very long times – hundreds of thousands of years – creating health hazards and waste-disposal problems. What’s more, the fission process, which involves chain reactions that induce fission, can be hard to control and shut down, as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, in Ukraine and Japan, showed. Fusion is “nuclear power done right” – potentially much cleaner, safer and more efficient. “It seems too good to be true – high power density, low and manageable waste production, and no possibility of uncontrolled energy release,” says Tim Luce, chief scientist on the large international fusion project Iter, in the south of France. “But it is true!”\\nPinterest\\nInside the tokamak at Culham, Oxfordshire. Photograph: M Woollard/M.Woollard\\nSince its completion in 1983, Jet has been working towards the holy grail of net energy gain: extracting more from the fusion process than is put in to keep it alive. Its reactor induces fusion in a super-hot plasma of hydrogen fuel suspended by magnetic fields inside a doughnut-shaped device called a tokamak – the word is a Russian acronym, the design having first been proposed in the 1950s by Soviet physicists.\\nIn 1997 Jet set a world record for the highest ratio of energy out to energy in. But that was still just two-thirds of the break-even point where the reactor isn’t consuming energy overall. Jet was always intended as an experimental facility, however, and it will eventually hand on the baton to the $20bn Iter project, on which the EU and six other nations, including the United States, Russia and China, are collaborating. The construction of Iter is now nearing completion at Cadarache, near Aix-en-Provence. It hopes to conduct its first experimental runs in 2025, and eventually to produce 500 megawatts (MW) of power – 10 times as much as is needed to operate it. “The role of Iter is to realise power-plant levels of power and gain, and to begin to address the technological needs of power plants,” says Luce.\\nThe fuel used in these and other fusion reactors is not ordinary hydrogen – the lightest element, with a nucleus containing just one proton – but heavier hydrogen isotopes called deuterium and tritium, which also have neutrons in their nuclei. The presence of neutrons lets fusion happen under less extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Deuterium is abundant: it makes up 0.02% of all the natural hydrogen in seawater, from which it can be extracted. But tritium is very rare and radioactive, disintegrating with a half-life of 12 and a quarter years.\\nTritium can be produced directly at a fusion facility by using the neutrons released as nuclei fuse to break apart lithium atoms, so that a reactor may “breed” its own fuel. It can also be extracted from heavy (deuterium-rich) water, which is how Jet gets it. But it’s costly, so deuterium-tritium fuel is only used on major test runs. Jet plans to conduct one next year – the first since the record-breaking demonstration in 1997. “We remain very optimistic that we’ll break the world record for fusion energy produced,” says Chapman. “Everyone is very excited because we haven’t done it for 20 years.” Iter, meanwhile, hopes to start using deuterium-tritium fuel in 2035.\\nJet won’t be jeopardised by Brexit. Chapman says that “we’ve signed a contract to operate Jet to the end of 2020, whatever happens with Brexit. And we’re already talking with our European partners about an extension to the end of 2024.”\\nPinterest\\nAn artist’s illustration of nuclear fusion. Photograph: David Parker/Science Photo Library\\nThat’s not true of the UK’s role in Iter, however, which is the real big hope for the future of fusion. The country’s membership of the project comes through its affiliation with the European atomic energy programme Euratom – which is coupled to EU membership. “If you leave one, you leave the other,” says Tony Donné, programme manager of Eurofusion. With a withdrawal agreement, he says, “in principle the UK could stay in Euratom until the end of 2020, and then it’s in an easier position to negotiate for associate membership, as Switzerland already has”. But without one, the UK would need to renegotiate a fresh position in Iter from scratch. That’s possible – Ukraine has done it – but Donné says: “It would take a long time and I don’t know how it would go.”\\nHe adds: “In fusion, we have a tradition to work internationally, so it would be a pity if the UK [were to] drop out.” Even if it eventually became possible to rejoin Iter, “British industries might lose their chance of orders, and then when the UK comes back in in a few years’ time, maybe all the nice orders will have been given to other companies.”\\nNot everything depends on these big international collaborations, however. The British government has given £220m to a UK-based project called Step (the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), which aims to build a working fusion reactor that will feed 100MW into the national grid by 2040. Later phases of the project will be cofunded by industry, and Step’s director Howard Wilson, a physicist at the University of York, says that it will benefit from the work done in parallel at Iter.\\nStep uses a different design from Jet or Iter: the aforementioned spherical tokamak. “Rather than a ring doughnut, it looks more like a cored apple,” Wilson says. “The hole in the middle is much smaller.” This makes the reactor more compact and therefore potentially cheaper (that, perhaps, is what Johnson had in mind when alluding to “miniature” fusion reactors). But the spherical shape also creates problems, in particular dealing with the greater concentration of heat.\\nOne of the biggest challenges is the damage caused to the reactor materials by the extreme heat and the intense doses of neutron radiation. Iter won’t suffer too much of that because it will only run for short bursts. But a commercial reactor would need to operate more frequently, if not continuously, to be economically viable. Since Step will run more in that manner, it will need to tackle this crucial engineering issue.\\nPinterest\\nThe construction of Iter, France. Photograph: Iter\\nThe United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has explored spherical tokamaks since building the world’s first prototype, called Start (the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak), in the 1990s. This design is also favoured by some of the small startup companies now trying to develop commercial fusion, such as Tokamak Energy , based at Milton Park, a few miles south of Culham in Abingdon. They hope to create a reactor small enough to fit on to the back of a lorry; the idea is that such systems could provide power locally to a factory or a town. But these companies – others exist in the US and Canada – are nowhere near having market-ready devices.\\nThe bigger projects welcome this injection of diversity. “We don’t see ourselves as in competition with the startups, but as complementary,” says Wilson. Chapman agrees: “The more bright people working on the problems, the better. I don’t think any of those companies is going to design and build a working reactor, but they might innovate on a particular component and help drive down the costs or improve performance.”\\nThe idea of having a nuclear reactor on the edge of town might sound alarming. But that’s largely because we have become familiar with the dangers of fission – the radioactive waste and the spectre of Chernobyl-style meltdowns. Fusion is different: there’s no real risk of it getting out of control, and much less radiation hazard. Chapman likens the process to a gas oven: “Fusion stops almost instantaneously once you stop fuelling it”, and a reactor typically only contains about one second’s worth of fuel at any moment. The challenge, he says, is to keep it going: “I’ve spent most of my career trying to do that.”\\nNo one believes that fusion will solve the immediate climate crisis. It’s not expected to come online until 2050, by which time many scientists say carbon emissions will already need to have fallen to zero to avoid the most serious climate impacts. But neither can renewables such as wind and solar power solve the problem on their own – their intermittency and low power density means, for example, that you couldn’t power large cities that way. Fusion will be perfect in that situation, says Donné, and he predicts it will be a major component of global energy generation in the second half of this century.\\n“I came to fusion because I passionately believe that it is needed – that it can change the world,” says Chapman. “I’m convinced that not only is fusion important: it’s going to happen.” We’re not on the verge, but it’s just about in sight.\\nTopics',\n",
       " 'Nuclear fusion is \\'a question of when, not if\\'\\nBy Matt McGrath Environment correspondent\\n6 November 2019\\nThese are external links and will open in a new window\\nClose share panel\\nImage copyright BBC Sport\\nImage caption An artist\\'s impression of how a fusion reactor might look\\nThe prospects for developing nuclear fusion as a feasible source of energy have significantly improved, say experts.\\nThe UK government has recently announced an investment of £200m to deliver electricity from a fusion reactor by 2040.\\nPrivate companies and governments have told the BBC they aim to have demonstration models working within five years.\\nBut huge hurdles remain, say critics.\\nWith the price of wind and solar continuing to drop, experts say these existing renewables might offer a more economical and timely method of tackling climate change and generating energy than an unproven technology like fusion.\\n\\'Skunk power\\' fires fusion confusion\\nNuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes of the Sun on Earth. It differs significantly from nuclear fission, which has been our only way of getting electricity from atoms since the 1950s.\\nFission has proven to be hugely expensive. It generates large amounts of radioactive waste and raises serious concerns about safety and the proliferation of weapons.\\nSo what exactly is fusion?\\nFusion is the process that drives our Sun.\\nEvery single second, millions of tonnes of hydrogen atoms crash together in the tremendous temperatures and pressures of our parent star. This forces them to break their atomic bonds and fuse to make the heavier element, helium.\\nImage copyright ITER\\nImage caption The giant Iter site in southern France aims to have its first plasma generated in 2025\\nNatural, solar fusion generates enormous quantities of heat and light.\\nFor decades, researchers have been trying to replicate this process on Earth, or \"build the Sun in a box\" as one physicist dubbed it. The basic idea is to take a type of hydrogen gas, heat it to more than 100 million degrees until it forms a thin, fragile cloud called a plasma, and then control it with powerful magnets until the atoms fuse and release energy.\\nPotentially, it can generate power that is low carbon, with much smaller amounts of waste. It also comes without the danger of explosions.\\nTo deliver the fusion concept, countries have focused their energies on a major international co-operative effort called Iter.\\nGiant step forward or a white elephant?\\nThe Iter project involves 35 countries and, right now, it is constructing a huge test reactor in southern France.\\nThe plan is to have the first plasma generated in 2025. However, getting from this step to producing energy is extremely difficult.\\nIter has also been beset by long delays and budget overspend which means it is unlikely to have a demonstration fusion power plant working even by 2050.\\n\"One of the reasons that Iter is late is that it is really, really hard,\" said Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority.\\n\"What we are doing is fundamentally pushing the barriers of what\\'s known in the technology world. And of course you reach hurdles and you have to overcome them, which we do all the time and Iter will happen, I am completely convinced of it.\"\\nImage copyright General Fusion\\nImage caption General Fusion believe their approach to fusion will work within five years\\nUntil Iter is up and running in 2025, the UK based Joint European Torus (Jet) remains the world\\'s largest fusion experiment.\\nIt has secured EU funding until the end of 2020, but what happens after that, and the participation of the UK in Iter after Brexit remain unclear.\\nTo give some sense of certainty, the UK government recently announced £220m for the conceptual design of a fusion power station by 2040.\\nOver the next four years, researchers based at Culham in Oxfordshire will develop designs for a fusion power plant called Step or Spherical Tokomak for Energy Production.\\nHow will the UK make fusion work?\\nThe most widely known approach to making fusion happen involves a doughnut shaped vacuum chamber called a Tokomak. Hydrogen gas is heated to 100 million degrees C at which point it become a plasma. Powerful magnets are used to confine and steer the plasma until fusion occurs.\\nIn the UK, researchers have developed a different form of Tokamak, that more resembles an apple core than a doughnut. Called a Spherical Tokamak, it has the advantage of being more compact, potentially allowing future power plants to be located in towns and cities.\\n\"If you look at some of the very big units, the big machines that we are looking at, just finding geographically somewhere to put them is difficult,\" said Nanna Heiberg from the UK Atomic Energy Authority.\\n\"What you really want to do is put them close to where the energy is required. And so if you can do them in a much smaller footprint, you can put them closer to the users and you can put more of them around the country for example.\"\\nSo where is the excitement about fusion coming from?\\nWhile governments are wrestling with Iter, many are also driving ahead with their own national plans. China, India, Russia and the US among others are working on developing commercial reactors.\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\nImage caption Building the \"sun in a box\" has remained outside the grip of scientists for decades\\nAs well as the UK government putting cash in, the European Investment Bank is pumping hundreds of millions of euros into an Italian programme to produce fusion energy by 2050.\\nBut perhaps the major excitement comes from private companies. They are usually smaller, nimbler, and they develop by making mistakes and learning from them quickly.\\nThere are now dozens of them around the world, raising funds and pushing forward often with different approaches to fusion than that seen in Iter and in the UK.\\nHere\\'s a brief sample of some different approaches to fusion.\\nFirst Light: This company originated in the University of Oxford and was founded specifically to address the urgent need to decarbonise the global energy system. Their idea involves firing a projectile at a target that contains hydrogen atoms. The shockwave from the impact of the projectile creates a shockwave that crushes the fuel and briefly this reaction will produce plasma that is hotter than the sun and denser than lead.\\nCommonwealth Fusion System s: A private company created by former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) staff, CFS has raised significant funding of over $100m. It is focusing on developing a Tokamak system but its key innovation is in superconducting magnets. They hope to build powerful enough magnets so they can build smaller and cheaper Tokomaks to contain the plasmas required to generate fusion.\\nTAE Technologies: With backing from Google and other high tech investors, this California-based company is using a different mix of fuel to develop smaller, cheaper reactors. They want to use hydrogen and boron as both elements are readily available and non-radioactive. Their prototype is a cylindrical colliding beam fusion reactor (CBFR) that heats hydrogen gas to form two rings of plasma. These are merged and held together with beams of neutral particles to make it hotter and last longer.\\nUS Navy : Worried about how to power their ships in the future, the US Navy has filed a patent for a \"plasma compression fusion device\". The patent says that it would use magnetic fields to create \"accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin\". The idea would be to make fusion power reactors small enough to be portable. There\\'s a lot of scepticism that this approach will work.\\n\\'A ball of liquid metal...\\'\\nOne of the main challengers with ambitions to make fusion work is a company based in British Columbia, Canada called General Fusion . Their approach, which has gathered a lot of attention and backing from the likes of Amazon\\'s Jeff Bezos, combines cutting edge physics with off the shelf technology.\\nThey call their system \"magnetised target fusion\".\\nThis approach sees a hot gas plasma injected into a ball of liquid metal inside a steel sphere. It is then compressed by pistons, much like in a diesel engine.\\n\"The pistons all fire simultaneously and collapse the cavity with the fuel inside,\" said Michael Delage, the company\\'s chief technology officer.\\n\"So at the peak of that compression when the fuel bursts into fusion reaction, it is surrounded on all sides by liquid metal so the energy goes into the metal and you take this hot liquid metal and boil water, make steam and make electricity.\"\\nGeneral Fusion say they hope to have a working model within five years.\\nWhy hasn\\'t fusion worked so far?\\nDespite the hopes, no one to date has managed to get more energy out of a fusion experiment than they have put in.\\nMost experts are confident the idea will work, but many believe that it is a matter of scale. To make it work, you have to go large.\\n\"I think fusion needs resources to really make it work,\" said Prof Ian Chapman from UKAEA. \"You could do that within a company or a country but you really need to have the requisite scale and resources.\"\\nImage copyright General Fusion\\nImage caption The compression system for the General Fusion reactor featuring large scale pistons\\n\"When ITER works, and I say when, not if, it will be a step change for fusion and you will see massive investment come into the field.\"\\nWill renewable energy make fusion redundant?\\nIn 2018, the IPCC reported that emissions of carbon dioxide need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C.\\nGetting to that point requires a rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector. The UK has committed to Net Zero emissions by 2050 which will require the deployment of wind and solar on a massive scale. Some argue this is should be a greater priority for Britain, rather than spending large sums on experimental fusion reactors.\\n\"The cost of renewables has shot down while the cost of the world fusion project, Iter has gone up and it now looks very unlikely they will be able to compete without new ideas,\" said Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, a one time chair of the ITER council and a respected British physicist.\\n\"I don\\'t think this means we should give up on fusion, there are ways it could become cheaper but it is not going to be there immediately when we need in the UK at least.\"\\nOthers involved in the fusion industry take a different view.\\n\"If you\\'re a country like Malaysia, that has a high carbon intensity of its energy system, and you\\'re trying to move away from coal, there\\'s not a lot of options today,\" said Chris Mowry, General Fusion\\'s chief executive.\\n\"This is the type of application we\\'re focused on. And even in countries like Canada, which have a fair amount of renewables, it can never be 100% renewables.\"\\n\"And so we need a carbon free source of energy that can complement renewables in the future.\"',\n",

       " 'An Overview of National AI Strategies\\nJun 28, 2018 · 25 min read\\nThe race to become the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) has officially begun. In the past fifteen months, Canada, China, Denmark, the EU Commission, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Nordic-Baltic region, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the UAE, and the UK have all released strategies to promote the use and development of AI. No two strategies are alike, with each focusing on different aspects of AI policy: scientific research, talent development, skills and education, public and private sector adoption, ethics and inclusion, standards and regulations, and data and digital infrastructure.\\nThis article summarizes the key policies and goals of each strategy, as well as related policies and initiatives that have announced since the release of the initial strategies. It also includes countries that have announced their intention to develop a strategy or have related AI policies in place.\\nI plan to continuously update this article as new strategies and initiatives are announced. If a country or policy is missing (or if something in the summary is incorrect), please leave a comment and I will update the article as soon as possible.\\nI also plan to write an article for each country that provides an in-depth look at AI policy. Once these articles are written, I will include a link to the bottom of each country’s summary.\\nUpdate History\\nJune 28: Publication of original article, included Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, EU Commission, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, UAE, US, and UK.\\nJuly 13: Added Italy, Kenya, New Zealand, Nordic-Baltic Region, Mexico, Sweden, Taiwan, and Tunisia. New information for Germany, the UK, and the US.\\nJuly 25: Added Malaysia, Poland, and Russia. New information for Germany.\\nTable of Contents\\nUnited States\\nAustralia\\nAustralia does not yet have an artificial intelligence strategy. However, in the 2018–2019 Australian budget, the government announced a four-year, AU$29.9 million investment to support the development of AI in Australia. The government will create a Technology Roadmap, a Standards Framework, and a national AI Ethics Framework to support the responsible development of AI. The investment will also support Cooperative Research Centre projects, PhD scholarships, and other initiatives to increase the supply of AI talent in Australia. In addition, in the its 2017 innovation roadmap, Australia 2030: Prosperity Through Innovation , the government announced that it will prioritize AI in the government’s forthcoming Digital Economy Strategy. This report is expected to be released in the second half of 2018.\\nCanada\\nPrime Minister Trudeau announcing the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy | via MP Raj Grewal News\\nCanada was the first country to release a national AI strategy. Detailed in the 2017 federal budget, the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy is a five-year, C$125 million plan to invest in AI research and talent. The strategy has four goals: (1) increase the number of AI researchers and graduates, (2) establish three clusters of scientific excellence, (3) develop thought leadership on the economic, ethical, policy, and legal implications of AI, and (4) support the national research community on AI. The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research leads the strategy in close partnership with the Canadian government and the three new AI Institutes: the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII) in Edmonton, the Vector Institute in Toronto, and MILA in Montreal.\\nCanada’s AI strategy is distinct from other strategies because it is primarily a research and talent strategy. It’s initiatives — the new AI Institutes, CIFAR Chairs in AI, and the National AI program — are all geared towards enhancing Canada’s international profile as a leader in AI research and training. The CIFAR AI & Society Program examines the policy and ethical implications of AI, but the overall strategy does not include policies found in other strategies such as investments in strategic sectors, data and privacy, or skills development. That is not to say that the Canadian government does not have these policies in place, but that they are separate from, rather than part of, the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy.\\nChina\\nChina announced its ambition to lead the world in AI theories, technologies, and applications in its July 2017 plan, A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan . The plan is the most comprehensive of all national AI strategies, with initiatives and goals for R&D, industrialization, talent development, education and skills acquisition, standard setting and regulations, ethical norms, and security. It is best understood as a three step plan: first, make China’s AI industry “in-line” with competitors by 2020; second, reach “world-leading” in some AI fields by 2025; and third, become the “primary” center for AI innovation by 2030. By 2030, the government aims to cultivate an AI industry worth 1 trillion RMB, with related industries worth 10 trillion RMB. The plan also lays out the government’s intention to recruit the world’s best AI talent, strengthen the training of the domestic AI labour force, and lead the world in laws, regulations, and ethical norms that promote the development of AI. The latter includes the intent to actively participate in and lead the global governance of AI.\\nSince the release of the Next Generation Plan, the government has published the Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Development of New-Generation Artificial Intelligence Industry . This plan builds on the first step of the Next Generation plan to bring China’s AI industry in-line with competitors by 2020. Specifically, it advances four major tasks: (1) focus on developing intelligent and networked products such as vehicles, service robots, and identification systems, (2) emphasize the development AI’s support system, including intelligent sensors and neural network chips, (3) encourage the development of intelligent manufacturing, and (4) improve the environment for the development of AI by investing in industry training resources, standard testing, and cybersecurity. In addition, the government has also partnered with national tech companies to develop research and industrial leadership in specific fields of AI and will build a $2.1 billion technology park for AI research in Beijing.\\nDenmark\\nDenmark’s Strategy for Denmark’s Digital Growth , released January 2018, aims to make Denmark a leader in the digital revolution and to create growth and wealth for all Danish people. Rather than focusing exclusively on advances in AI, the strategy concentrates on AI, big data, and the Internet of Things. The strategy has three goals: (1) make Danish businesses the best at using digital technologies; (2) have the best conditions in place for the digital transformation of business; and (3) ensure every Dane is equipped with the necessary digital skills to compete. As per funding, a pool of DKK 75 million has been allocated in 2018, followed by DKK 125 million each year until 2025, and DKK 75 million in perpetuity for the implementation of the strategy’s initiatives.\\nIn total, the report outlines 38 new initiatives. Major announcements include the creation of Digital Hub Denmark (a public-private cluster for digital technologies), SME:Digital (a coordinated scheme to support the digital transformation of Danish SMEs), and the Technology Pact (a nationwide initiative to foster digital skills). The government also announced initiatives to further open government data, experiment with regulatory sandboxes, and strengthen cybersecurity.\\nEU Commission\\nA timeline for the EU Commission AI strategy | via Tim Dutton\\nIn April 2018, the EU Commission adopted the Communication on Artificial Intelligence : a 20-page document that lays out the EU’s approach to AI. The EU Commission aims to: (1) increase the EU’s technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake by the public and private sectors; (2) prepare Europeans for the socioeconomic changes brought about by AI; and (3) ensure that an appropriate ethical and legal framework is in place. Key initiatives include a commitment to increase the EU’s investment in AI from €500 million in 2017 to €1.5 billion by the end of 2020, the creation of the European AI Alliance ( which people can now join ), and a new set of AI ethics guidelines to address issues such as fairness, safety, and transparency. A new High-Level Group on Artificial Intelligence will act as the steering group for the European AI Alliance and will prepare the draft ethics guidelines for member states to consider.\\nThe Commission is now working with member states to develop a coordinated plan on AI by the end of 2018. The goal of the forthcoming plan will be to “maximize the impact of investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU, exchange best practices and collectively define the way forward to ensure that the EU as a whole can compete globally.”\\nFinland\\nIn May 2017, Finland’s Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä appointed a steering group to examine how Finland can become one of the world’s top countries at the application of AI technologies. Though the group will not release its final report until April 2019, it has already released two interim reports and the Finnish government has begun to incorporate the group’s recommendations into government policy. The first report, Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence , surveyed Finland’s strengths and weaknesses in AI and provided eight recommendations to turn Finland into a global leader in the application of AI. Key initiative included the creation of the Finnish Centre for AI (a joint partnership by Aalto and Helsinki Universities to increase AI research, talent, and industry collaboration), an AI accelerator pilot program, and the integration of AI in the public service. A second interim report, Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence , gives an additional 28 policy recommendations related to four aspects of the future of work: growth and employment; labour market; learning and skills; and ethics.\\nFrance\\nPresident Emmanuel Macron unveiled France’s €1.5 billion plan to transform France into a global leader in AI research, training, and industry at the end of the AI for Humanity Summit in Paris. The plan draws heavily from the report, For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence: Towards a French and European Strategy , in which Cédric Villani, France’s famed mathematician and Deputy for the Essonne, and the other members of the “Villani Mission” outlined a number of policies and initiatives for the government to consider.\\nThe plan consists of four components. First, Macron announced several initiatives to strengthen France’s AI ecosystem and attract the international talent. Key among them was the announcement of the National Artificial Intelligence Programme, which will create a network of four or five research institutes across France. Second, France will develop an open data policy to drive the adoption and application of AI in sectors where France already has the potential for AI excellence, such as healthcare. Third, the government will create a regulatory and financial framework to support the development of domestic “AI champions.” Finally, the government will development regulations for ethics to ensure that the use and development of AI is transparent, explainable, and non-discriminatory.\\nIn total, the government will invest €1.5 billion in AI by the end of the current five-year term. Details for the following have not be released, but €700 million will go towards research, €100 million this year to AI startups and companies, €70 million annually through France’s Public Investment Bank, and $400 million to industrial projects in AI. The Villani report recommended focusing on four sectors (healthcare, transportation, environment, and defence), but Macron did not reference this recommendation. Instead, he only talked about the potential of AI for healthcare and transportation.\\nPresident Macron delivering his speech during the AI For Humanity Conference | via Reuters\\nGermany\\nPrior to releasing its AI strategy, which will be published at the Digital Summit 2018 in Nuremberg (December 3–4), Germany’s federal cabinet released a paper in July 2018 that outlines the goals of the strategy. In short, the government wants to strengthen and expand German and European research in AI and focus on the transfer of research results to the private sector and the creation of AI applications. Proposed initiatives to achieve this include new research centres, Franco-Germany research and development collaboration, regional cluster funding, and support for SMEs and start-ups. The proposed plan is quite comprehensive and also includes measures to attract international talent, respond to the changing nature of work, integrate AI into government services, make public data more accessible, and promote the development of transparent and ethical AI. Overall, the government wants “AI made in Germany” to become a globally recognized seal of quality.\\nIn addition to its forthcoming strategy, Germany already has a number of related policies in place to develop AI. Principally, the government, in partnership with academia and industry actors, focuses on integrating AI technologies into Germany’s export sectors . The flagship program has been Industry 4.0 , but recently the strategic goal has shifted to smart services , which relies more on AI technologies. The German Research Centre for AI (DFKI) is a major actor in this pursuit and provides funding for application oriented research. Other relevant organizations include the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation , which promotes academic cooperation and attracts scientific talent to work in Germany, and the Plattform Lernende Systeme , which brings together experts from science, industry, politics, and civic organizations to develop practical recommendations for the government. The government has also announced a new commission to investigate how AI and algorithmic decision-making will affect society. It consists of 19 MPs and 19 AI experts and is tasked with developing a report with recommendations by 2020 (a similar task force released a report on the ethics of autonomous vehicles in June 2017).\\nIndia\\nIndia has taken a unique approach to its national AI strategy by focusing on how India can leverage AI not only for economic growth, but also for social inclusion. NITI Aayog, the government think tank that wrote the report, calls this approach #AIforAll. The strategy, as a result, aims to (1) enhance and empower Indians with the skills to find quality jobs; (2) invest in research and sectors that can maximize economic growth and social impact; and (3) scale Indian-made AI solutions to the rest of the developing world.\\nProposed integration of COREs and ICTAIs | via NITI Aayog\\nNITI Aayog provides over 30 policy recommendations to invest in scientific research, encourage reskilling and training, accelerate the adoption of AI across the value chain, and promote ethics, privacy, and security in AI. Its flagship initiative is a two-tiered integrated strategy to boost research in AI. First, new Centres of Research Excellence in AI (COREs) will focus on fundamental research. Second, the COREs will act as technology feeders for the International Centres for Transformational AI (ICTAIs), which will focus on creating AI-based applications in domains of societal importance. In the report, NITI Aayong identifies healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities, and smart mobility as the priority sectors that will benefit the most socially from applying AI. The report also recommends setting up a consortium of Ethics Councils at each CORE and ICTAI, developing sector specific guidelines on privacy, security, and ethics, creating a National AI Marketplace to increase market discovery and reduce time and cost of collecting data, and a number of initiatives to help the overall workforce acquire skills. Strategically, the government wants to establish India as an “AI Garage,” meaning that if a company can deploy an AI in India, it will then be applicable to the rest of the developing world.\\nItaly\\nItaly released a white paper on AI in March 2018. Unlike other strategies, which focus on research and development or private sector uptake, the white paper exclusively focuses on how the government can facilitate the adoption of AI technologies in the public administration. The white paper, Artificial Intelligence: At The Service of Citizens , was created by a task force for the Agency for Digital Italy. Given its focus, the paper devotes a significant amount of time to the challenges of integrating AI into government services. This includes concerns over ethics, the availability of skilled employees, the role of data, and legal implications. Taking these challenges into account, the paper concludes with a set of 10 recommendations for the government to consider. Recommendations included the creation of a National Competence Centre and a Trans-disciplinary Centre on AI, a national platform to promote the collection of annotated data, and measures to disseminate AI-related skills through the public administration. It is unclear whether Italy’s new government will implement and fund these recommendations.\\nIn July 2018, a consortium of universities and research centres in Italy united to create a new national laboratory for AI. CINI-AIIS Lab (Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems Lab) aims to strengthen Italy’s basic and applied research in AI, support the country’s ICT industry by promoting technology transfer from research to entrepreneurship, and promote the adoption of AI solutions in the public administration.\\nJapan\\nJapan was the second country to develop a national AI strategy. Based on instructions from Prime Minister Abe during the Public-Private Dialogue towards Investment for the Future in April 2016, the Strategic Council for AI Technology was established to develop “research and development goals and a roadmap for the industrialization of artificial intelligence.” The 11-member council had representatives from academia, industry, and government, including the President of Japan’s Society for the Promotion of Science, the President of the University of Tokyo, and the Chairman of Toyota.\\nJapan’s three-phase development plan for AI | via the Industrialization Roadmap\\nThe plan, the Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy , was released in March 2017. The strategy is notable for its Industrialization Roadmap, which envisions AI as a service and organizes the development of AI into three phases: (1) the utilization and application of data-driven AI developed in various domains, (2) the public use of AI and data developed across various domains, and (3) the creation of ecosystems built by connecting multiplying domains. The strategy applies this framework to three priority areas of Japan’s Society 5.0 initiative— productivity, health, and mobility — and outlines policies to realize the industrialization roadmap. These policies include new investments in R&D, talent, public data, and start-ups.\\nKenya\\nIn January 2018, Kenya’s government announced a new task force to create a strategy that encourages the development and adoption of new technologies such as blockchain and AI. Two months later, the government formally unveiled the 11-person task force . Chaired by Bitange Ndemo, the former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communication, the task force’s goal is to provide recommendations on how the government can leverage new technologies in the next five years. The task force will also provide milestones for 2027 and 2032 and situate the strategy in the areas of financial inclusion, cybersecurity, land tilting, election process, single digital identity, and overall public service delivery. The strategy is not strictly about AI, but the technology is one of the many technologies that the government wants to harness in the coming years.\\nMalaysia\\nAs part of a larger effort to accelerate the adoption of digital technologies, Malaysia’s former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, announced in October 2017 a plan to develop a National AI Framework for Malaysia. Little information has been released since, but it was reported that the Prime Minister said that the framework would be an expansion of the National Big Data Analytics Framework, and will be led by Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC). Malaysia’s new government has not yet given an update on the National AI Framework.\\nMexico\\nTowards an AI Strategy in Mexico: Harnessing the AI Revolution is a white paper that lays out the foundations for a national AI strategy in Mexico. Released in June 2018, it was commissioned by the British Embassy in Mexico, funded by the UK’s Prosperity Fund, and developed by Oxford Insights and C Minds in close collaboration with the Mexican Government. The report surveys the current state of AI in Mexico, details relevant policies already in place, and describes potential use cases for AI at the national and regional levels. Based on evidence from over 60 interviews with local AI experts, the report concludes with a set of recommendations grouped into five categories: (1) government and public services, (2) data and digital infrastructure, (3) research and development, (4) capacity, skills and education, and (5) ethics.\\nThe current status of the strategy is unclear. In March, the government made an announcement about the report, thereby making it official government policy. But, due to Mexico’s summer election, the government has not started to implement the strategy. It is also unclear, as of the time of writing, whether Mexico’s new President will implement the report’s recommendations.\\nNew Zealand\\nNew Zealand’s Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media Clare Curran announced that her government is exploring the development of an AI action plan after a major third-party group called upon the government to develop one. AI Forum of New Zealand is an independent organization that brings together people from academia, industry, and government to advance New Zealand’s AI ecosystem. In May 2018, the organization released a report titled, “ Artificial Intelligence: Shaping a Future New Zealand .” The report surveys the global AI landscape, examines the potential impact of AI on New Zealand’s economy and society, and concludes with a set of recommendations for policymakers.\\nWith the goal of “fostering an environment where AI delivers inclusive benefits for the entire country,” the organization recommends that the government should focus on: (1) developing a coordinated national AI strategy, (2) creating awareness and understanding of AI in the public, (3) assisting the public and private sectors adopt AI technologies, (4) increasing access to trusted data, (5) growing the local AI talent pool, and (6) examining how AI affects laws and ethics. AI Forum NZ has also started two working groups to advance these goals: one focuses on fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI, while the other focuses on AI’s economic and labour impact.\\nNordic-Baltic Region\\nIn May 2018, the Ministers responsible for digital development from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, and the Åland Islands released a Declaration on AI in the Nordic-Baltic Region . The countries agreed to collaborate in order to “develop and promote the use of artificial intelligence to serve humans.” They specified that they will collaborate on: (1) improving opportunities for skills development, (2) enhancing access to data, (3) developing ethical and transparent guidelines, standards, principles, and values, (4) developing standards for hardware and software that enable privacy, security, and trust, (5) ensuring AI gets a prominent role in European discussions of the Digital Single Market, (6) avoiding unnecessary regulations, and (7) using the Nordic Council of Ministries to facilitate policy cooperation.\\nPoland\\nPoland’s government held its first roundtable on the development of a Polish AI strategy in May 2018. Attended by the Vice-President of the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, the Deputy Minister of Digital Affairs Karol Okoński, and representatives of the scientific community and related institutions, the roundtable focused on the policies and tools needed to foster an environment conducive to the creation of AI technologies in Poland. It is unclear when the government will release its strategy, but Prime Minister Jarosław Gowin stressed that is government is aware of the need to create a strategy and that Poland’s plan will include AI solutions for the future of health care, public administration, education and cybersecurity.\\nRussia\\nPresident Putin’s assertion that “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world” is frequently used by observers as evidence of a global AI arms race . But Putin’s statement is often quoted without context and, as a result, vastly overstates Russia’s AI capabilities. Speaking to students during a national “open lesson” on the first day of the school year in September 2017, Putin was asked a question about AI. He responded with the above quote, but also stated that “it would not be very desirable that this monopoly be concentrated in someone’s specific hands. That’s why, if we become leaders in this area, we will share this know-how with the entire world.” Putting aside whether or not Russia would actually share its AI technology with the world, this part of the quote is a crucial omission of Russia’s AI capabilities. “If we become leaders in this area” confirms that Russia is far from being a leader in the global AI race and is instead hustling to catch up . As Samuel Bendett reports for Defense One, “Russia’s annual domestic investment in AI is probably around 700 million rubles ($12.5 million) — a paltry sum next to the billions being spent by American and Chinese companies.”\\nIn March 2018, Russia’s Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Education and Science, and the Russian Academy of Sciences hosted a conference titled, “ Artificial Intelligence: Problems and Solutions — 2018 .” As a result of the conference, the Ministry of Defence released a list of 10 policies that the conference recommended. While the list is not an official strategy for the Russian government, it does lay the foundation for a national AI strategy. Key recommendations include creating a state system for AI education and talent retainment, establishing a national center for AI, and hosting war games to study the impact of AI on military operations.\\nSingapore\\nLaunched in May 2017, AI Singapore is a five-year, S$150 million national program to enhance Singapore’s capabilities in AI. It is a government-wide partnership involving six different organizations. Its goals are to invest in the next wave of AI research, address major societal and economic challenges, and broaden adoption and use of AI within industry.\\nOverview of Singapore’s AI strategy | via AI Singapore\\nThe program consists of four key initiatives. First, Fundamental AI Research funds scientific research that will contribute to the other pillars of AI Singapore. Second, Grand Challenges supports the work of multi-disciplinary teams that provide innovative solutions to major challenges Singapore and the world faces. Currently the program focuses on health, urban solutions, and finance. Third, 100 Experiments funds scalable AI solutions to industry-identified problems. Finally, AI Apprenticeship is a 9-month structured program to foster a new cohort of AI talent in Singapore.\\nIn June 2018, the government announced three new initiatives on AI governance and ethics . Principally, the new Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data will help the Government develop standards and governance frameworks for the ethics of AI.\\nSouth Korea\\nTrailer for AlphaGo | Via YouTube\\nSouth Korea’s Sputnik moment came when DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated Go’s world champion and Korean-native, Lee Sedol. In a six-day tournament in Seoul, watched by over 100 million people around the world, DeepMind’s AI-program AlphaGo bested Lee by a stunning 4 games to 1. Just two days after the competition concluded, South Korea’s government announced a ₩1 trillion investment in AI research over the next five years.\\nTwo years later, the South Korean government has announced a new five year, ₩2.2 trillion investment to strengthen the country’s R&D in AI. The strategy is divided into three parts . First, to secure AI talent, the government will establish six graduate school in AI by 2022 with the goal of training 5,000 AI specialists (1,400 AI researchers and 3,600 data management specialists). The government also announced an initiative to train 600 people in AI to address the immediate short term need for AI talent. The second area of focus is development of AI technology. The government will fund large scale projects in national defence, medicine, and public safety and will start an AI R&D challenge similar to DARPA. Finally, the government will invest in infrastructure to support the development of AI start-ups and SMEs. This includes funding for the creation of an AI semiconductor by 2029 and an AI-oriented start-up incubator to support emerging AI businesses.\\nSweden\\nSweden released its strategy, National Approach for Artificial Intelligence , in May 2018. It does not include specific policy announcements, but instead acts as a guiding document for all actors in Sweden to align towards. It outlines the strategic priorities for AI in Sweden and will serve as reference for all upcoming government decisions related to AI. Overall, the government wants to lead in the realization of AI benefits for competitiveness and welfare. To do this, the strategy argues that Sweden needs to train more skilled AI-professionals, increase basic and applied research in AI, and develop a legal framework to ensure the development of sustainable AI (AI applications that are ethical, safe, reliable, and transparent).\\nSince the launch of the strategy, the government has begun to rollout new policy initiatives. This includes funding for AI-training for professionals , an AI Science Park , and AI-related innovation projects through Vinnova (the government’s innovation agency). Prior to the release of the strategy, Vinnova also released an extensive review of Sweden’s capabilities and potential in AI (an English executive summary is available here ).\\nTaiwan\\nPremier William Lai announced Taiwan’s four-year “Taiwan AI Action Plan” in January 2018. As part of the Executive Yuan’s larger strategy to use Taiwan’s information technology and semiconductor industries to develop new smart technologies, the AI Action Plan, which has an annual budget of NT$10 billion over four years, has five key initiatives. First, the AI Talent Program aims to cultivate 1,000 advanced AI researchers and 10,000 AI-related professionals by 2021. The government will also actively recruit global AI talents and make it easier for them to start work in Taiwan. Second, the government plans to implement new pilot project based of the DARPA in the US and SIS in Japan in order to focus R&D into niche advantages for industrial development. Third, a new AI International Innovation Hub is being constructed with the aim of fostering 100 AI-related startups. Fourth, policymakers are testing open data fields and flexible regulations to support development of intelligent applications. The final initiative involves integrating AI technologies into the government’s larger 5 + 2 industrial innovation initiative .\\nTunisia\\nTunisia’s Secretary of State for Research has created a task force and a steering committee to develop a National AI Strategy for Tunisia . The strategy is currently scheduled to be published in the first quarter of 2019. The primary goal will be to facilitate the emergence of an AI ecosystem that acts as a strong lever for equitable and sustainable development and job creation.\\nThe development of the strategy was officially launched in April 2018 during a workshop hosted by the UNESCO Chair on Science, Technology and Innovation Policy, in partnership with the National Agency for Scientific Research Promotion-ANPR. Titled “National AI Strategy: Unlocking Tunisia’s capabilities potential,” the objective of the workshop was to share and discuss the task force’s framework and methodology for development of the strategy. Currently, the task force is establishing thematic and multi-stakeholder working groups to help identify priority areas and policies to be included in the strategy.\\nUAE\\nPromotional video for the UAE’s AI strategy | via YouTube, UAEai 2031\\nThe UAE government launched its AI strategy in October 2017. It is the first country in the Middle East to create an AI strategy and the first in the world to create a Ministry of Artificial Intelligence. The strategy is the first initiative of the larger UAE Centennial 2071 Plan and its primary goal is to use AI to enhance government performance and efficiency. The government will invest in AI technologies in nine sectors: transport, health, space, renewable energy, water, technology, education, environment, and traffic. In doing so, the government aims to cut costs across the government, diversify the economy, and position the UAE as a global leader in the application of AI.\\nUnited Kingdom\\nThe British government released the AI Sector Deal in April 2018. It is part of the government’s larger industrial strategy and aims to position the UK as a global leader in AI. It is quite comprehensive, with policies to boost public and private R&D, invest in STEM education, improve digital infrastructure, develop AI talent, and lead the global conversation on data ethics. Major announcements include over £300 million in private sector investment from domestic and foreign technology companies, the expansion of the Alan Turing Institute , the creation of Turing Fellowships, and the launch of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. The Centre in particular is a key program of the initiative, as the government wants to lead the global governance of AI ethics. A public consultation and a call for the chair of the Centre was launched in June 2018.\\nTen days before the release of the sector deal, the UK’s House of Lords’ Select Committee on AI published a lengthy report titled, AI in the UK: ready, willing, and able? The report is the culmination of a ten-month inquiry that was tasked with examining the economic, ethical, and social implications of advances in AI. The report outlines a number of recommendations for the government to consider, including calls to review the potential monopolization of data by technology companies, incentivize the development of new approaches to the auditing of datasets, and create a growth fund for UK SMEs working with AI. The report also argued that there is an opportunity for the UK to lead the global governance of AI and recommended hosting a global summit in 2019 to establish international norms for the use and development of AI. In June 2018, the government released an official response to the House of Lords that comments on each of the recommendations in the report.\\nUnited States\\nUnlike other countries, the US government does not have a coordinated national strategy to increase AI investment or respond to the societal challenges of AI. During the final months of Barack Obama’s presidency, the White House laid the foundation for a US strategy in three separate reports. The first report, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence , made specific recommendations related to AI regulations, public R&D, automation, ethics and fairness, and security. Its companion report, National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan , outlined a strategic plan for publicly funded R&D in AI, while the final report, Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy , examined in further detail the impact of automation and what policies are needed to increase the benefits of AI and mitigate its costs.\\nPresident Trump’s White House has taken a markedly different, free market-oriented approach to AI. In May 2018, the White House invited industry, academia, and government representatives to a summit on AI. In a speech at the conference, Michael Kratsios, Deputy Assistant to the President for Technology Policy, outlined the President’s approach to AI . He announced the government has four goals: (1) maintain American leadership in AI, (2) support the American worker, (3) promote public R&D; and (4) remove barriers to innovation. To achieve these objectives, Kratsios announced a new Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence to advise the White House on interagency AI R&D priorities and to consider the creation of Federal partnerships with industry and academia. He also specified that the government will focus on removing regulatory barriers to innovation so that American companies have the flexibility to innovative and grow.\\nIt is unclear how much the government invests in AI R&D. In the 2016 Research and Development Strategic Plan, the report specified that the government invested $1.1 billion in unclassified AI-related R&D projects in 2015. The summary document that the White House released after the May Summit announced that the Government’s investment in unclassified R&D for AI and related technologies has grown by over 40% since 2015, but it is unclear where the growth in R&D has come from. One likely answer is the military. According to a report by Govini , in its 2017 unclassified budget, the Pentagon spent approximately $7.4 billion on AI and the fields that support it, such as big data and cloud computing. This is up from $5.6 billion in 2012. The US military also invest billions more in classified R&D, but it is unknown how much this figure is. In June 2018, the Pentagon announced a new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that will have oversight over the majority of service and defence agency AI efforts.\\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\\nTim Dutton is an AI policy researcher based in Canada.

       " 'Revisiting the Implementation of AI Strategies\\nSummary: \\xa0Can all AI strategies be defined by a few common needs or are the different AI strategy models sufficiently unique that they need to be considered as separate approaches.\\n\\xa0\\nThere’s an article in the current Harvard Business Review titled “ Competing in the Age of AI ”.\\xa0 Since we’ve spent a good deal of energy thinking and writing about various AI strategies we were anxious to see what these leading business academics would add.\\nIn this article the authors try to develop a series of fairly simplistic rules that apply to all companies seeking to implement an AI strategy.\\xa0 This struck us as a little wrong-footed since we’ve identified six different AI strategies that involve very different business models.\\xa0 We’ll come back to their rules later.\\nWhat caught our attention however were the specific businesses used as examples in the article.\\xa0 In addition to the well-known AI platform models of Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent, and Wayfair, they proposed that their rules would apply equally to other models including Ant Financial, Zebra Medical Vision, Indigo Ag, and Ocado.\\xa0\\nWe know the platform players well.\\xa0 Remember that the core concept in a platform strategy is a two sided market (the platform) in which the business does not own either the supply or demand side resources, but binds them together and profits from the network effect of more and more users matching supply and demand through the platform.\\nThe question we needed to research was do these other referenced companies represent a different set of strategies we might have missed.\\xa0 Here’s what we found.\\n\\xa0\\nPure Play AI Products Companies – Vertical Strategy\\nTwo of the example companies, Zebra Medical Vision and Indigo Ag are pure play AI product companies.\\n\\xa0\\nZebra Medical Vision is focusing on medical applications of computer vision to provide automated interpretation of radiological images to speed up image diagnosis and presumably make it more accurate.\\xa0 Their product is an all-in-one platform for radiologists based entirely on the AI techniques of computer vision and image classification with DNNs.\\xa0 This fits our definition of a vertical strategy very well by providing a full process solution based on deep knowledge of a single industry with significant ownership of the underlying data on which the models are based.\\n\\xa0\\nIndigo Ag is similarly a pure play AI company using the deep learning techniques of computational biology to identify microbiome biologics that can be applied directly to seeds or soil to enhance output.\\xa0\\nThey combine this in a soil-to-sale platform that includes crop satellite imagery and a marketplace (platform) for matching growers and buyers (although the core of the company is not a platform strategy).\\nThese business models started with a focus on a set of AI techniques and built unique business verticals not resembling any current traditional competitors.\\xa0 There are still vertical market opportunities available but they are not common.\\xa0 Our observation is that most of these companies become M&A targets for established industry players.\\n\\xa0\\nAI Disruptors\\nIf we missed anything in our previous discussions of AI strategy it may be this category of AI Disruptors.\\xa0 While essentially all large well established companies are constrained to use an “Applied AI” strategy in which AI is grafted onto the existing business model to optimize various processes, these AI Disruptors set out to recreate the capabilities of an existing business without reference to old-model processes.\\n\\xa0\\nAnt Financial spun out from Alibaba just five years ago Ant already services one billion customers and employees one-tenth the number of workers compared to traditional financial institutions.\\xa0 Per the authors:\\n“Unlike traditional banks, investment institutions, and insurance companies, Ant Financial is built on a digital core. There are no workers in its “critical path” of operating activities. AI runs the show. There is no manager approving loans, no employee providing financial advice, no representative authorizing consumer medical expenses. And without the operating constraints that limit traditional firms, Ant Financial can compete in unprecedented ways and achieve unbridled growth and impact across a variety of industries.”\\n\\xa0\\nOcado is an on-line supermarket founded in 2000 with the goal of transforming the supermarket industry.\\xa0 Although they originally had a brick-and-mortar arm that’s subsequently been spun off, their focus has been on AI-enabled robotic pick-and-pack systems which is their core competence.\\xa0 They claim to be the world’s largest online-only grocery platform.\\nWhile they are disrupting the traditional supermarket business model they are also successfully marketing their warehouse fulfillment equipment to traditional retailers looking to add AI enhanced automation.\\n\\xa0\\nDo General Rules Apply to All AI Strategies\\nThe HBR authors assert that what all these models including the giant platform players have in common are these four requirements.\\n“Four components are essential to every [AI] factory.\\nThe first is the data pipeline, the semiautomated process that gathers, cleans, integrates, and safeguards data in a systematic, sustainable, and scalable way.\\nThe second is algorithms, which generate predictions about future states or actions of the business.\\nThe third is an experimentation platform, on which hypotheses regarding new algorithms are tested to ensure that their suggestions are having the intended effect.\\nThe fourth is infrastructure, the systems that embed this process in software and connect it to internal and external users.”\\nAt its most basic level this is certainly true of ‘Applied AI’ strategies for existing businesses.\\xa0 But it strikes us that the design, methods of implementation, and even the management of these required elements varies greatly by strategy type.\\xa0 Mixing the requirements of existing businesses seeking to graft on AI with those of platform, vertical, or AI pure play companies is not very explanatory.\\nFor example, when Walmart wants to add AI enabled automation to its warehouse it considerations are quite different from that of Ocado.\\xa0 Walmart has the advantage of a huge trove of consumer purchase history.\\xa0 Ocado no doubt initially suffered from the cold start data problem.\\nWhen Zebra or Indigo were designing their platforms they were much more concerned with the effort of creating algorithms than other verticals where the much simpler application of ML models likely sufficed.\\nWhen Ant turned its AI loose on loan approvals it desire for the process to be largely autonomous led to much different monitoring and control processes than the average financial institution which may use ML models to make recommendations reviewed by managers.\\nSo while these four elements of the so-called AI Factory are probably common, the considerations in design and implementation are decidedly not common.\\n\\xa0',\n",

NOW posted stronger-than-projected Q4 2019 results on January 29. Analysts have since raised their fiscal 2020 and 2021 earnings estimates for the fast-growing, cloud-focused business services firm.\\nServiceNow’s Quick Pitch\\nServiceNow was founded in 2004 and went public in 2012. The Santa Clara, California-based firm grabbed the No. 3 spot on Fortune’s Future 50 list of global companies “with the best prospects for long-term growth” in both 2019 and 2018. This put NOW ahead of the likes of Salesforce CRM, Netflix NFLX, Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, and many others.\\nServiceNow last summer expanded its partnership with Microsoft MSFT. The updated relationship with Microsoft will help ServiceNow sell to highly regulated industries and see it house its full SaaS offerings on MSFT’s Azure cloud, which competes directly against Amazon AMZN.\\nMore recently, the cloud-centered digital workflows firm was added to the S&P 500 index in November. And new CEO Bill McDermott, who took over in mid-November, bought $1 million worth of NOW shares.

       " 'Snap Quarterly Revenue Disappoints; Stock Tumbles\\nSarah Frier\\n•\\nFebruary 4, 2020\\n(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. reported quarterly sales that missed Wall Street estimates, a sign that the photo-sharing app is finding it harder to carve out a niche in the crowded digital-advertising market. Shares slumped 12% in extended trading.\\nFourth-quarter sales totaled $560.9 million, the company said Tuesday in a statement. That was less than analysts’ average projection of $562.9 million. Snap’s first-quarter revenue forecast also came in slightly below expectations.\\nThe owner of the Snapchat app last year executed a turnaround after a much-criticized redesign, a series of executive departures and job cuts, and a rocky 2017 initial public offering. The company added more users than expected in the fourth quarter, as people downloaded a better Android version of the photo chat app, but it still isn’t profitable -- Snap reported a quarterly and annual net loss, including a $100 million payment to settle a lawsuit related to the IPO. Before the report, investors had been optimistic about the company’s prospects, and the stock had gained about 16% this year.\\n“We are working hard to scale our revenue so that we are able to self-fund our investments in the future,” Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said in prepared remarks to investors.\\nThe stock dropped as low as $16.08 in late trading following the earnings report, after closing at $18.98 in New York earlier on Tuesday.\\nSnap operates in a competitive digital-advertising market, where Google and Facebook Inc. capture the bulk of sales. It also faces the emergence of new competitors for young social-media users, like ByteDance Inc.’s TikTok. Still, Spiegel argues Snap has an opportunity to sell advertisers access to a younger audience.\\nThe Santa Monica, California-based company said on Tuesday that it had 218 million daily active users in the fourth quarter, beating the 214.2 million average analyst estimate. Besides the Android improvements, the company has been drawing more users in with creative photo tools, such as filters that manipulate the age of your face on a sliding scale.\\nThe company’s net loss in the recent period, including the legal-settlement charge, was $240.7 million, or 17 cents a share.

       " 'Josh Constine @JoshConstine / 5 days\\nSnapchat still isn’t profitable nearly two years after its IPO. In Q4 2019, Snap lost $241 million on 560.8 million in revenue that’s up 44% year-over-year and an EPS of $0.03. That comes from adding 8 million daily users to reach a total of 218, up 3.8% this quarter from 210 million and 17% year-over-year.\\nThe big problem was a one-time $100 million legal settlement that pushed it to lose $49 million more in Q4 2019 than Q4 2018. That comes from a shareholders lawsuit claiming Snap didn’t adequately disclose the impact of competition from Facebook on its business. The IPO was soured by weak user growth as people shifted from Snapchat Stories to Instagram Stories.\\nA rough Q4\\nSnapchat had a mixed quarter compared to estimates, exceeding the EPS predicitions but falling short on revenue. FactSet’s consensus predicted $563 million in revenue and a loss of $0.12 EPS. Estimize’s consensus came in at $568 million in revenue and an EPS gain of $0.02.\\nSnapchat shares plunged over 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Shares had closed up 4.17% at $18.99 today. That’s up from a low of $4.99 in December 2018 when its user count was shrinking under competition from Instagram Stories. It’s now hovering around its $17 IPO price but it’s still under its post-IPO pop to $27.09.\\nSnap gave stronger than expected revenue guidance for Q1 2020 of $450 million to $470 million, and 224 million to 225 million users. The company’s CFO Derek Anderson says that “Q4 marked our first quarter of Adjusted EBITDA profitability at $42 million for the quarter, an improvement of $93 million over the prior year.” Still, he predicts an Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of negative $90 million to negative $70 million. That’s manageable for Snap without raising more money, since it now has $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, down $148 million quarter-after-quarter.\\nSnapchat 2020\\n“Throughout the course of 2019, we added 31 million daily active users, largely driven by investments in our core product and improvements to our Android application “said Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel . “We’ve recently completed our 2020 strategic planning process and have aligned our teams and resources around our goals of supporting real friendships on Snapchat, expanding our service to a broader global community, investing in our AR and content platforms, and scaling revenue while achieving profitability in order to self-fund our investments in the future.”\\nSome other highlights:\\n1.3 trillion Snaps were created in 2019\\nThe average Snapchat user engages for 30 minutes per day,\\nSnapchat reaches 90% of US 13 to 24 year-olds and over 75% of 13 to 34 year-olds\\nTotal daily time spent by Snapchatters watching Discover increased by 35% year-over-year, and its up 60% for users over the age of 25\\nOver 50 Snapchat shows reached a monthly audience of 10 million viewers or more\\n75% of users engage with augmented reality per day\\n20% of Snaps sent with an AR lens were made with commununity-developed lenses\\n5X more users open the Lens Explorer now versus a year ago, and 10% of users open it every day\\nSnapchat’s user growth has been on tear thanks to international penetration, especially in India, after it re-engineered its Android app for developing markets. It gained users in all markets. Crucially, it raised its average revenue per user 23% from $2.09 in Q4 2018 to $2.58, though only from $1.24 to $1.35 in the Rest Of World region where it’s growing user count the fastest. Snap will need to figure out how to squeeze more cash out of the international market to offset the costs of streaming tons of video to these users.\\nQ4 saw Snapchat readying several new products that could help boost engagement and therefore ad views. Cameos, first reported by TechCrunch, lets users graft their face onto an actor in an animated GIF like a lightweight Deepfake. Bitmoji TV , which won’t run ads initially but could drive attention to Snapchat Discover, offers zany four-minute cartoons that star your Bitmoji avatar. We could see a bump to engagement from these starting in Q1 2020.\\nTo retain its augmented reality filter creators, Snapchat has pledged $750,000 in payouts in 2020. It’s also expanded the use of product catalog ads , and now lets advertisers buy longer skippable ads .\\nOutside of the legal settlement, Snapchat is inching closer to profitability but still has a ways to go. It’s managed to develop a strong synergy between its popular chat feature that’s tougher to monetize, and the Stories and Discover content where it can inject ads. The big question is whether Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp will get more serious about ephemeral messaging that’s at the core of Snapchat. If it can hold onto the market and maintain its place as where teens talk, it could ride out its costs and build revenue until it’s sustainable for the long-term.',\n",

Pretty much any repository on GitHub can be turned into a website with the click of two buttons.\\nDo you need an online portfolio of your work for potential employers to check out but you don’t know how to make a website? Do you want to create a blog or a business site but you don’t know where to start? Is it possible that you just don’t want to deal with (or pay for) website hosting, domain names, and everything else?\\nThis one’s for you!\\nPhoto by Leonard Alcira on Unsplash\\nWhy should I have a website?\\nIt’s hard to imagine anyone who wouldn’t benefit from having a website! You might need to display your portfolio for potential clients or employers. You might need to organize your projects in a way that you can share. You may want to create a blog about the things you’re doing or the places you’ve been. You might need to advertise yourself or your business or sell a product. Whatever your reason, there’s a good chance that you want to put something together without spending a ton of time on it. There’s an even better chance that you don’t want to spend a lot of money.\\nPhoto by imarksm via Pixabay\\nA website is a way to connect with the world and it’s a powerful tool for communication. It’s a way to share your work, your interests, and your passions. It’s how you can create, build, and control your online image. Plus, the sooner you build your site, the more time you’ll have to build your online presence and reach the people that you want to reach. It can help you stand out in a sea of competitors.\\nIt’s also not the easiest thing to create if you don’t know what you’re doing!\\nThere are a few ways that a beginner can create a simple and completely free website. The main ones are GitHub and Wordpress.\\nWordpress is great for beginners who need all the help. I love Wordpress! That’s how I got started with my very first blog! The thing about a free Wordpress site is that it’s really obvious that it’s a Wordpress site. You have an address that ends in wordpress.com and a Wordpress logo at the bottom of every page.\\nIf you’re getting started in the tech world, you’re going to find that you look more appealing if you know how to use GitHub. If you’ve been in the tech world for a little while now, there’s a very good chance that you already have somewhere between one and one million repositories on GitHub right now.\\nWhy not build your website on GitHub and host it right from your repository?\\nGIF via GIPHY\\nSo much of what matters in the tech world right now is contributing to open source. Sharing your work openly in the community is a big deal. GitHub is designed for exactly this. Putting your work on GitHub shows that you’re involved and aware. ( I host my portfolio right from a repository on GitHub if you want to take a look . It’s pretty out-of-date, but it is an example of a profile site built with Bootstrap and hosted from a GitHub repo.)\\nWhen you share your projects on GitHub, people can see your code, what you’re doing, and how you’re doing it. GitHub is all about the communication of ideas.\\nPretty much everyone in tech right now is using Git and/or GitHub in some way. Having your profile right there on GitHub is a great way to hold up your hand and get involved. Plus, you’ll wind up with a repository and some commits on your profile page!\\nIf you’re brand new to everything Git, you might want to check out “ Getting Started with Git and GitHub: the complete beginner’s guide .” That article will walk you through the basics of what Git and GitHub are, concepts like “repositories,” and a ton more. I’m going to assume that you already know the basics. If you don’t, it’s worth taking a few minutes to get acquainted with them.\\nLet’s get this party started!\\nThere are two ways of getting started with your website. You might be starting completely from scratch! On the other hand, you might have a website that you’ve already put together, but you don’t know how to use GitHub to turn it into a free website.\\nI’ll start with option 2.\\nGIF via GIPHY\\nI have the files, but I don’t know what to do with them!\\nThis couldn’t be easier. Seriously! GitHub does the rest of the work for you. I’m assuming that you already have a GitHub account and that you know what a repository is, but if you don’t, check out that getting started with Git and GitHub article .\\nIn a nutshell, a repository is where your project will live. It’s where you’ll organize your project. You’ll keep folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, Jupyter notebooks, data sets, and anything else your project needs in your repository.\\nIf you haven’t already, go ahead and initialize your project with a repository, or create a new repository and upload your files . If you have a file called “index.html” GitHub will already understand what you want to do.\\nNow you’re going to take advantage of GitHub Pages . Go to your GitHub repository and click “Settings.”\\nScroll down to “GitHub pages.” You’ll see this:\\nNow drop the “Source” dropdown menu to either “master branch” or “master branch/docs folder.” Here’s the thing: if you want to publish from your “docs” folder, you seriously need to have a “docs” folder in your master branch from which you want to run your website!\\nChances are, if you’re a beginner, you’ll choose “master branch,” which just means that you want to publish your repository pretty much as-is. (There have been a couple of times where I needed to tweak a file path or two, depending on how I had my folders structured.)\\nYou’re going to see a notification that your site is ready to be published.\\nBe patient, wait a minute or two, and then refresh the page or try the link if you want. Once your site has been published, you’ll see this:\\nTry clicking on that link.\\nPoof! You have a free website!\\nCongratulations!!!\\nNow for the other option:\\nI don’t even know how to get started!\\nI’m going to tackle things like Bootstrap and basic website design another time and focus on the absolute basics here. I do want you to know, though, that the world is your oyster! The only thing limiting your options here is your drive to make it happen. (Well, maybe drive and also the amount of time you have available…) Because this option is for the complete beginner, I’m going to show you how to do everything right on the GitHub website.\\nWe’ll go ahead and create a new repository first.\\nFill in your repository name, a short description, check the box that says “Initialize this repository with a README,” and then click “Create repository.”\\nNow go to “Settings” near the top right-hand side of the screen and then scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section. Drop the dropdown menu that says “None” to “master branch.”\\nFirst, you’ll see this:\\nWait a minute or two, and then you’ll see this:\\nNow click the link!\\nYou have a website! Congratulations!\\nThat doesn’t look like much\\nOkay, that does look pretty boring, but you can see here that what’s displaying is your README file.\\nIf you want to make some quick changes, you can go ahead and edit your README to display what you want people to see. To do that, go back into your repository, click the little pencil icon on your README file, and make it better!\\nEdit your README file\\nEditing the file (you’re working with a Markdown file)\\nHow the file looks with a few edits!\\nYou’re using Markdown, and there are a lot of things you can do with markdown files. This includes adding text, images, links, colors, and some basic formatting. It’s a seriously simple way to start! Here’s the Markdown Guide to basic syntax for anyone who hasn’t worked with it before.\\n(Remember that if you add any images to your README, you want to make sure to upload them to your repository, or GitHub won’t know what you want!)\\nNow go back to your website and see what you have!\\nBe aware that it sometimes takes a few minutes for the changes to go through. If you don’t see your changes immediately, wait a few minutes and try again. I’ve also had an issue where my laptop wanted to keep going back to an older version of my website even though I’d made changes. Deleting my browser history for the last 24 hours fixed that problem. Try the easy fixes before you freak out about the complicated stuff!\\nGIF via GIPHY\\nThat’s an improvement, but it could be more interesting\\nIf you’re a total beginner and you don’t know anything about CSS, but you want a little more visual appeal, try a Jekyll theme! They’re prebuilt themes that you can use to make your site look a little better with basically no effort on your end. Jekyll and GitHub will do the work for you! Your job is to push a button or two.\\nGo back to the “GitHub Pages” section in “Settings” and click on “Choose a theme.”\\nLet’s see what our website looks like if we choose the first theme that shows up. All you have to do is press the green “Select theme” button, give it a couple of minutes, and then try your website again!\\nAnd with just a few minutes of effort, we’re already getting somewhere!\\nThat’s it! In just a few minutes, you created your own free website for your business, blog, or portfolio, hosted it through a GitHub repository, and it’s already up and running. You’re ready to share with the world!\\nWay to go!!!\\nJust a couple of notes:\\n* If you decide that you don’t want to use a theme after all, there’s no button to go back to the original version. It’s actually totally easy to get rid of your theme, though! If you go back to your repository, you’ll discover that you now have a file called “_config.yml” which contains your theme information. If you delete that file, you delete the theme!\\n* If you want to play around with your theme and theme options, you’ll find that the “_config.yml” file is your first stop. Now that you know that, take a look at the zillions of other Jekyll options that you have! You can even start with the Jekyll Now theme if you want a simple and already set-up blog. Your options are endless!\\nI can’t wait to see what you create! As always, if you make anything amazing with this information, let everyone know about it in the comments below.\\nIf you want to reach out or find more cool articles, please come and join me at Content Simplicity !\\nYou might also want to check out some of my other tutorials for beginners here on Medium!',\n",

       " \"How to Build a Reporting Dashboard using Dash and Plotly\\nMar 11, 2019 · 24 min read\\nIn this blog post, I will provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to build a reporting dashboard using Dash , a Python framework for building analytical web applications. Rather than go over the basics of building a Dash app, I provide a detailed guide to building a multi-page dashboard with data tables and graphs.\\nI built the reporting dashboard as a multi-page app in order to break up the dashboard into different pages so it less overwhelming and to present data in an organized fashion. On each dashboard page, there are two data tables, a date range selector, a data download link, as well as a set of graphs below the two dashboards. I ran into several technical challenges while building the dashboard and I describe in detail how I overcame these challenges.\\nThe completed Dashboard can be viewed at https://davidcomfort-dash-app1.herokuapp.com/cc-travel-report/paid-search/ and the code is provided in Github . (The data used in the app is random data and the names for the products are “dummy” names.)\\nFigure 1: Dashboard built using Dash\\nFigure 2: Second Part of Dashboard\\nTable of Contents\\n16. Resources for Dash\\n1. Introduction\\nIn January of this year, I went to my first PyData conference, PyData Miami , and sat in on a great presentation by Chelsea Douglas about Dash .\\nEmbedded Video 1: Dash: data exploration web apps in pure Python — Chelsea Douglas\\nIt quickly became apparent how powerful Dash was and how I easily I could build web apps and dashboards using Python.\\nFrom my perspective, there was a real need in my company to automate reporting, replace Microsoft Excel pivot tables and spreadsheets, and provide an alternative to Business Intelligence tools. Even though various stakeholders in my company have relied upon Excel spreadsheets for regular reporting, their usage becomes unwieldy, they are prone to error, they are not platform independent, and they do not lend themselves to automation.\\nTherefore, I endeavored to build a multi-page web application using Dash. This article goes into the nitty, gritty details of my efforts and how I overcame several technical challenges. I should note that I come from a data scientist perspective and make no claims to be a software developer. Hence, there certainly is room for improvement in my code and I would welcome the reader’s suggestions. At the same time, I hope the reader can benefit from my efforts if they need to build complex dashboards and data tables.\\n2. What am I Trying to Achieve with a Dashboard?\\nAt my present company, a lot of periodic reporting is done either with Excel spreadsheets and pivot tables, or using business intelligence tools such as Birst or Qlikview . Hence, I wanted to build a reporting dashboard as a proof-of-concept that could replace and enhance our reporting. Specifically, I wanted to build a reporting web application for one of brands, which could report out on different marketing channel metrics, enable automation and provide ease of access.\\nThe requirements for the E-commerce Marketing Dashboard included:\\nBreak out the different marketing channels into different pages so that the amount of data presented in the dashboard would not be overwhelming.\\nA date selector so a user can select a date range to filter the data.\\nA data table to present basic metrics (spend, sessions, number of transactions, and revenue) for each digital marketing channel or product type for the date range selected, as well as for the same period last year and a corresponding period prior to the date range selected.*\\nAnother data table to present calculated metrics for the date range selected (as well as for the same period last year and prior period). These metrics include cost-per-session (CPS), conversion rate (CVR), and CPA (cost-per-acquisition).\\nA link to download the data (in Excel format) that is displayed in each data table.\\nGraphs of the metrics on a weekly basis are to be depicted below the data tables.\\nAn example of a corresponding prior period would be if a user selected week numbers 5 and 6 of 2019, then the corresponding prior period would be week numbers 3 and 4 of 2019.\\n3. Challenges Building the Dashboard\\nThere were multiple challenges that cropped up when I was building the dashboard app. Some of the main challenges included:\\nFiguring out a method to display either a condensed data table or a complete data table.\\nHaving the ability to color code cells in the data tables, based upon the value in that cell.\\nHaving the ability to select multiple products to include in a graphical representation of the data.\\nHaving the ability to update the metrics in the data tables on-the-fly, depending upon the date range a user selects.\\nHaving the ability to download the data presented in the data tables without any added formatting.\\nDepicting year-to-year changes in metrics on the same x-axis as a given metric.\\nBeing able to zoom in on all graphs at the same time.\\n4. Creating a New Environment and Installing Dash\\nThere is a Dash User Guide , which provides a fairly thorough introduction to Dash and I encourage the reader to go through the user guide and build some simple Dash apps prior to tackling a full fledged dashboard. In addition, there is a Dash Community Forum , a show-and-tell section of the forum highlighting work by the Dash community, a gallery of Dash projects, a curated list of awesome Dash resources, and an introductory essay about Dash:\\nDash is a Open Source Python library for creating reactive, Web-based applications. Dash started as a public proof-of-concept on GitHub 2 years ago. We kept this prototype online, but subsequent work on Dash occurred behind closed doors. We used feedback from private trials at banks, labs, and data science teams to guide the product forward. Today, we’re excited to announce the first public release of Dash that is both enterprise-ready and a first-class member of Plotly’s open-source tools. Dash can be downloaded today from Python’s package manager with pip install dash — it’s entirely open-source and MIT licensed. You’ll find a getting started guide here and the Dash code on GitHub here .\\nDash is a user interface library for creating analytical web applications. Those who use Python for data analysis, data exploration, visualization, modelling, instrument control, and reporting will find immediate use for Dash.\\nDash makes it dead-simple to build a GUI around your data analysis code.\\nPrior to installing Dash, as is the usual practice, I created a new environment using conda : conda create --name dash and then activated that environment, conda activate dash. I then simply followed the Dash installation protocol provided in the user guide:\\nCode Block 1: Pip installing Dash and its components\\nI should note that the versions for Dash and its components will change from above and you should refer to the User Guide .\\n5. Getting Started with Dash\\nThere are already quite a few tutorials for Dash, so I will focus on how to build a multi-page dashboard with data tables and graphs in this tutorial, rather than go over the basics of building a Dash app.\\nIf you are just getting started in Dash, I would encourage the reader to go through at least the first three sections of the excellent Dash User Guide . There is also a section on the Dash Data Table . There are several tutorials to get you started*:\\nIntroducing Plotly Dash — A high level introduction to Dash by Chris Parmer, the author of Dash. This essay was released as part of Dash’s official launch (June 21, 2017).\\n*From the Awesome Dash Github page.\\nEssentially, Dash apps are composed of two parts: (1) the “layout” of the app that describes the look and feel of the app, and (2) the “callbacks” that enable the apps to be interactive. A simple Dash App Layout is presented in the user guide and reproduced below:\\nCode Block 2: Simple Dash App Layout\\nThe dashboard which I describe in this tutorial splits up the Dash app into different files and enables one to build a multi-page app.\\nThere is an “index” page which renders different pages, or layouts, depending the URL. Each individual layout consists of several different Dash components, including a date range picker, data tables, a download link, and several graphs. Each of these components is related to one or more “callbacks” that enable the dashboard to be interactive.\\nA user can interact with one of the Dash components (e.g., change the date range) and the other components reflect this change (e.g., cause the data presented in the data tables to change).\\nA schematic of this approach is in the following diagram:\\nFigure 3: Schematic of Dashboard files\\n6. Building a Multi-page Application\\nThe structure of multi-page Dash application, based upon the Dash documentation at https://dash.plot.ly/urls , with slight tweaks, is presented below:\\nCode Block 3: File Structure of a Multi-page Dash App\\nThe file app.py simply has the following:\\nCode Block 4: app.py\\nNote that I am using the dash authentication module ( https://dash.plot.ly/authentication ). This has some implications which I will go into below.\\nBuilding the Index Page\\nThe index.py file essentially defines the URL page structure of the app by defining a function display_page, which determines what page layout should be rendered depending upon the app URL.\\nCode Block 5: index.py\\nThis is very similar to the index.py page in the Dash Vanguard Report at https://github.com/plotly/dash-vanguard-report , with a demo at ( https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-vanguard-report/portfolio-management ).\\nHowever, I had to include the line from app import server, in order to overcome an issue when I deployed the app on Heroku (see https://community.plot.ly/t/nolayoutexception-on-deployment-of-multi-page-dash-app-example-code/12463 for details).\\nCustomizing the Page Title and Favicon\\nIn addition, I wanted to customize the app’s HTML index template, specifically, the page title and the favicon. In order to do so, I added the following index_string: to index.py:\\nCode Block 6: index_string in index.py File\\nIn order to order to customize the favicon, the favicon.ico image can be placed in the assets directory.\\nOverview of the Page Layout\\nThe callback in the index.py file takes as input the app URL and outputs different layouts depending upon the layout:\\nCode Block 7: Callback in index.py File\\nThe layouts.py file contains the following:\\nNormal python import statements\\nA simplified code block for one layout section in the layouts.py is below:\\nCode Block 9: Section of layouts.py to render Paid Search Page\\nThe above code does not include conditional formatting, which I will go into below.\\nLocal Testing of the App\\nFollowing the user guide, after one has created the index.py and app.py files, one invokes the app with\\n$ python app.py\\n...Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\\nand visit http:127.0.0.1:8050/cc-travel-report/paid-search/ in your web browser.\\n7. Building the Date Selector Element\\nFigure 4: Date Selector Element\\nThe date selector element provided a means to update the data presented in both data tables, as well as the downloaded data link. I also wanted the date selector to provide feedback on the dates selected by the user.\\nI simply chose January 1, 2018 as the minimum date allowed (min_date_allowed); The maximum date allowed was based upon the maximum date in the CSV data file (max_date_allowed); the initial month presented in the date selected was based upon the maximum date in the CSV data file (initial_visible_month); the initial start date was the maximum date minus 6 days (start_date); and the initial end date was the maximum date.\\nThe following code is located in the layouts.py file and needs to be repeated for each “page” of the Dashboard app.\\nCode Block 10: Html Element for Date Picker in layouts.py File\\nI used a callback and a function, update_output to provide feedback to the user. Specifically, I wanted to provide text feedback on the dates selected, the number of days selected, as well as the dates in the corresponding previous period. For instance, if a user had selected week numbers 5 and 6 of 2019 using the date range selector, then the corresponding past period would be week numbers 3 and 4 of 2019. The update_output function below provides this functionality.\\nCode Block 11: Callback and Function for Date Picker in layouts.py file\\nThe date picker element provides input to the callbacks for the first data table, the second data table, the download link, as well as the set of graphs below the data tables. I will go into detail how each of these callbacks work, with their associated outputs.\\nAdding a correction to CSS so that the Date Picker is not hidden behind the data tables\\nOne issue I had to correct was that the data tables obscured the date picker element, so I had to correct the CSS accordingly.\\nCode Block 12: CSS for change z-index of data table in custom.css file\\n8. Building the First Data Table\\nFigure 5: First Data Table with a Condensed View\\nThe first data table in the dashboard presents metrics such as spend (the cost associated with a given advertising product), website sessions, bookings (transactions), and revenue. These metrics are aggregated depending upon the dates selected in the date selected and typically present data for the current year for the date range selected, data for the previous corresponding period, data for last year, as well as percent and absolute differences between these periods.\\nChanging the Dates Presented in the Data Table based upon the Date Selection\\nThe main functionality I wanted for the first data table is making it interactive, whereby the data presented changes according in the date selected. To start with, the data table element needs to be included in the layouts.py file as in the (simplified) code below:\\nCode Block 13: Data Table Component in layouts.py File\\nThe different parameters for the data table include:\\nid : identifier so that the data table can be referenced by the callbacks.\\ncolumns : the columns presented in the table; deletable gives the ability of the user to delete the column while using the app.\\neditable=True gives the user the ability to change the data in the table while using the app.\\nn_fixed_columns=2 freezes the first two columns (the checkboxes and the placement type in our case), so when a user scrolls across the complete data table, the user can still view the check boxes and the placement type.\\nstyle_table allows CSS styles to be applied to the table.\\nrow_selectable='multi' allows the user to select multiple rows via the checkboxes. This will enable updating of the graphs below based upon the selection.\\nselected_rows=0 contains the index of the rows that are selected initially (and presented in the graphs below).\\nstyle_cell allows CSS styles to be applied to the table cells.\\nI will add additional parameters in a subsequent step so we can have conditional style formatting. Number formatting such as dollar signs, commas, and percent signs are added in pandas and defined as a series of formatters.\\nI should note that I do not specify the data parameter for the data table in the layouts.py file. Rather, the data parameter for the data table will come from the callback:\\nCode Block 14: Callback for First Data Table in layouts.py File\\nCalculating Changes in the Metrics, as well as the calculating cost-per-session, conversion rate, and cost-per-acquisition.\\nSince we need to calculate changes in the metrics, as well as CPA, CPS, and conversion rate depending upon the dates selected “on-the-fly,” I push these calculations into a separate file, functions.py. I can then re-use these functions for the different Dashboard pages. I also define formatting functions in this file:\\nCode Block 15: Data Formatters in functions.py file\\nThe functions for both the first data table and the second data table are similar so I only present one here:\\nCode Block 16: update_first_datatable Function in functions.py\\nThe flow between the data table element, the callback and the function can be portrayed as:\\nFigure 6: Flow for the first data table\\nA method to select either a condensed data table or the complete data table.\\nOne of the features that I wanted for the data table was the ability to show a “condensed” version of the table as well as the complete data table. Therefore, I included a radio button in the layouts.py file to select which version of the table to present:\\nCode Block 17: Radio Button in layouts.py\\nThe callback for this functionality takes input from the radio button and outputs the columns to render in the data table:\\nCode Block 18: Callback for Radio Button in layouts.py File\\nThis callback is a little bit more complicated since I am adding columns for conditional formatting (which I will go into below). Essentially, just as the callback below is changing the data presented in the data table based upon the dates selected using the callback statement,Output('datatable-paid-search', 'data', this callback is changing the columns presented in the data table based upon the radio button selection using the callback statement, Output('datatable-paid-search', 'columns'.\\nConditionally Color-Code Different Data Table cells\\nOne of the features which the stakeholders wanted for the data table was the ability to have certain numbers or cells in the data table to be highlighted based upon a metric’s value; red for negative numbers for instance. However, conditional formatting of data table cells has three main issues.\\nThere is lack of formatting functionality in Dash Data Tables at this time.\\nIf a number is formatted prior to inclusion in a Dash Data Table (in pandas for instance), then data table functionality such as sorting and filtering does not work properly.\\nThere is a bug in the Dash data table code in which conditional formatting does not work properly.\\nI ended up formatting the numbers in the data table in pandas despite the above limitations. I discovered that conditional formatting in Dash does not work properly for formatted numbers (numbers with commas, dollar signs, percent signs, etc.). Indeed, I found out that there is a bug with the method described in the Conditional Formatting — Highlighting Cells section of the Dash Data Table User Guide:\\nCode Block 19: Conditional Formatting — Highlighting Cells\\nThe cell for New York City temperature shows up as green even though the value is less than 3.9.* I’ve tested this in other scenarios and it seems like the conditional formatting for numbers only uses the integer part of the condition (“3” but not “3.9”). The filter for Temperature used for conditional formatting somehow truncates the significant digits and only considers the integer part of a number. I posted to the Dash community forum about this bug, and it has since been fixed in a recent version of Dash.\\n*This has since been corrected in the Dash Documentation.\\nConditional Formatting of Cells using Doppelganger Columns\\nDue to the above limitations with conditional formatting of cells, I came up with an alternative method in which I add “doppelganger” columns to both the pandas data frame and Dash data table. These doppelganger columns had either the value of the original column, or the value of the original column multiplied by 100 (to overcome the bug when the decimal portion of a value is not considered by conditional filtering). Then, the doppelganger columns can be added to the data table but are hidden from view with the following statements:\\nCode Block 20: Adding Doppelganger Columns\\nThen, the conditional cell formatting can be implemented using the following syntax:\\nCode Block 21: Conditional Cell Formatting\\nEssentially, the filter is applied on the “doppelganger” column, Revenue_YoY_percent_conditional (filtering cells in which the value is less than 0). However, the formatting is applied on the corresponding “real” column, Revenue YoY (%). One can imagine other usages for this method of conditional formatting; for instance, highlighting outlier values.\\nThe complete statement for the data table is below (with conditional formatting for odd and even rows, as well highlighting cells that are above a certain threshold using the doppelganger method):\\nCode Block 22: Data Table with Conditional Formatting\\nI describe the method to update the graphs using the selected rows in the data table below.\\n9. Building the Download Data link\\nFigure 7: Download data link\\nOne of the features I wanted for the dashboard was the ability to download the data that was presented in the data tables. Specifically, I wanted the downloaded data to be updated according to the dates selected (and presented in the data tables). In addition, since the dates are not displayed, it was necessary to add the dates to the downloaded file. Moreover, even though the data is formatted in the data tables (with $, % , and thousand comma separators, I wanted the downloaded data to be free of formatting.\\nThere were two critical Plotly community threads which helped me to build this functionality at Allow users to dowload [sic] an Excel in a click and Allowing users to download CSV on click .\\nThe download data functionality was implemented using the following:\\nThere is simply a placeholder for the download button in the layouts.py file.\\nCode Block 23: Placeholder for Download Button\\nYou will need the following modules for the download link to work properly:\\nCode Block 24: Import Statements to Enable Download Functionality\\nThe callback for the excel download is placed in the callbacks.py file. The callback is taking the start_date and the end_date from the date picker element and outputting a file reference to the download link.\\nThe update_link function is updating the URL link to serve, based upon the start and end dates.\\nThe function download_excel_1 takes the URL value and splits it up back into start_date and end_date so that I can name the filename based upon the start and end dates, as well as the current date.\\nCode Block 25: Callback and function for excel download data link\\nThe function download_excel_1 also calls another function, update_first_download, which is very similar to the update_first_download function presented above, except that the data is not formatted.\\nThe downloaded Excel file is named according to the product name and the start and end dates selected, as well as the current date. Columns for the start and end dates and other appropriate dates are added to the downloaded data file.\\nFigure 8: Snap shot of the downloaded data.\\n10. Building the Second Data Table\\nFigure 9: Data Table with Calculated Metrics\\nThe second data table featured metrics such as cost-per-session, conversion rate and and cost-per-session which are calculated “on-the-fly,” depending upon the dates selected in the date range selected.\\nThe second data table is created is a similar manner to the first data table so the details are left out of this tutorial, but the complete files are on Github .\\n11. Updating Graphs by Selecting Rows in a Dash Data table\\nFigure 10: Digital Marketing Metric Graphs\\nThe graphs below the data tables display metrics aggregated by week, and include the current year’s data, last year’s data, as well as the percentage changes between the two.\\nFigure 11: Diagram of callback and function to update graphs\\nThe steps to update the graphs are:\\nSet placeholder in the layouts.py file.\\nCreate callback for each set of graphs, for each page of the Dashboard in the callbacks.py file.\\nBuild a function which filters the complete list of products by the list of products selected in the Dash data table, and subsequently creates a pandas data frame based upon this selection.\\nThe filtered data frame is then passed to another function, update_graph that (a) calculates metrics such as cost-per-session, conversion rate and cost-per session, and (b) produces the output for the graphs.\\nThese steps are detailed below. Step 4 is detailed in Section 12, “Updating the Graphs and Calculating metrics on the fly.”\\nStep 1\\nIn the layouts.py file, there is simply a placeholder for the graphs:\\nCode Block 26: Placeholder for Graphs\\nStep 2\\nThere is a callback for each set of graphs on each page in the callbacks.py file:\\nCode Block 27: Callback for Graphs\\nThe callback takes input from the first data table, as well as input from the date picker, and outputs to the dcc.Graph element with the id, paid-search.\\nStep 3\\nOne of the challenges I had had was to figure out a way of updating the graphs depending upon the products selected in the data table.\\nIn the code for the first data table, it was necessary to set the parameters for row_selectable to multi and selected_rows=[0]. The former parameter enables checkboxes next to each row in the data table, whereas the latter parameter ensures that the selected rows has an initial value. The parameter, n_fixed_columns freezes the first two rows in the data table so that they are visible when a user enables the complete data frame, (thus exposing all of the available columns).\\nHere is a simplified code block for the first data table (which is in the layouts.py file):\\nCode Block 28: Simplified Data Table Definition\\nHence, the callback for the graphs acquire the selected_rows. In the function to update the graphs, update_paid_search, a list of products is built by filtering the original data frame by the dashboard page category (Paid Search in this case) and getting a complete list of unique placement types. Then, a for loop filters this list by the list of products selected in the data table. Subsequently, a filtered data frame, filtered_df is created by filtering the original data frame by the list of selected products and performing a pandas groupby and summing the spend, sessions, bookings and revenue columns. The callback and function, update_paid_search, for the graphs is presented below:\\nCode Block 29: Callback and Update Function for Graphs\\n12. Updating the Graphs and Calculating metrics on the fly\\nThe graphs for each metric are aggregated by week and by the products that are selected in the data table (as detailed above).\\nThe features I wanted for the graphs and for the update function included:\\nSince the graphs can depict metrics on more than one product at a time, the update function needs to calculate the metrics on-the-fly.\\nThe graph for each metric should include the value for this year, the value for last year, as well as the year-to-year percentage difference.These should be overlaid on the same graph, with the values being line graphs, and the year-to-year change being bar graphs.\\nI wanted the zoom function to work across all of the graphs simultaneously, such that zooming in on one graph, zooms in the other graphs at the same zoom level.\\nThe complete update_graph function (which resides in the functions.py file is below:\\nCode Block 30: update_graph Function in functions.py File\\nIn order to “group” the graphs together, I utilized the subplot capability of Plotly detailed at https://plot.ly/python/subplots/ . The update_graph function has the following main elements:\\nOn-the-fly calculation of the metrics.\\nEach graph “trace” is defined using the graph_objs method in the Plotly library (remember to import this method viaimport plotly.graph_objs as go). Specifically, each graph is defined with the go.Scatter method:\\nCode Block 31: Trace Assignment for each Graph element\\nThe main graph figure and its parameters are defined when we call tools.make_subplots. During app development, I found that potential sources of error are not remembering to change the number of rows when you add additional traces ( rows=6) , as well as ensuring that you have the same number of titles as the number of graphs. Both of these might cause the app to fail.\\nCode Block 32: make_subplots To Set Parameters for Subplots\\nThe different subplot “traces” are appended to the main graph figure with the statements such as fig.append_trace(sessions_ty, 1, 1), where sessions_ty is the trace name defined above; the first number, 1 is the graph number and the last number is the column number (which is 1 in every case since we only have one column). I have included commented-out numbers for each trace in order to assist me in the next step.\\nCode Block 33: Appending Trace to the Figure\\nIn order to overlay the year-to-year changes, I had to have several update statements, as well as adding new y-axes for each overlaid graph (the year-to-year change graphs). The syntax required for these overlaid graphs was a little tricky.\\nCode Block 34: Code to Overlay Year-to-Year Change Graphs\\nFor instance, in the first update statement, the index number 2 in the statement fig['data'][2] refers to the third trace, sessions_yoy (since Python is zero-indexed).\\nThe following figure hopefully assists in visualizing the indexing of the various elements of the combined graph.\\nFigure 12: Schematic of the Different Axis Indexes\\nThe y-axis name, y7, in the statement yaxis='y7' needs to be 7 since there are already 6 y-axes (one for each metric: sessions, spend, bookings, cpa, cps, and cr. For each metric, this year’s and last year’s data shares the same left y-axis). Hence, we need start numbering the right-side y axes at 7.\\nWe need to assign the parameter for each of the additional y-axes using the fig['layout']['yaxis'] statements. Specifically, the first right-side axis for the year-to-year changes in sessions overlaps with the other session traces in the first graph. Hence, we need to assign the parameters accordingly: overlaying='y1', anchor='x1' and, of course, we need to assign it to the right side by setting side='right'. In addition, I update the title of the set of the graphs with the following:\\nCode Block 35: Update Title of Graphs\\nFinally, I need to update the overall figure layout with the following statement. I should note that there are several parameters below which are commented out since I am still experimenting with different parameters.\\nCode Block 36: Update Overall Figure Layout\\n13. Plotly Graph Tools\\nI should note that there are several helpful tools available in Dash to manipulate the graphs. If you hover over the top right-side of the graph figure, you can view these tools.\\nFigure 13: Plotly Graph Tools\\nWith these tools you can:\\nDrag to zoom in and double-click to return to the original graph.\\nDrag the corners of a graph to zoom along one axis.\\nDouble-click to autoscale a single axis.\\nChange the hover mode to compare data or investigate a single data point.\\nCertainly, one of the nicest tools is the ability to download a pic of the graph:\\nFigure 14: Downloaded image of the graphs\\n14. Deploying the Dashboard\\nI essentially followed the Deploying Dash Apps guide in the Dash User Guide , with a few changes. Specifically, I deployed the Dashboard on Heroku using the following steps:\\nStep 1: I had already created a folder for the my dashboard code in a previous step.\\nCode Block 37: Mkdir and cd Code\\nStep 2: Initialize the folder with git . Rather than use venv, I had previously set up a conda environment for Dash.\\nCode Block 38: Init Git and Active Dash Conda Environment\\nAnd I had either installed the app’s dependencies using either conda or pip:\\nCode Block 39: Pip Installation of Dash and other Modules\\nYou will also need a new dependency, gunicorn, for deploying the app (line 10 in the above code segment).\\nStep 3: Initialize folder with an app ( app.py), a .gitignore file, a requirements.txt file, and a Procfile file for deployment. We only need a minimal app.py since we are defining our app using multiple files. You need to create the following files in your project folder.\\napp.py\\nCode Block 40: app.py file (previously created)\\n.gitignore\\nCode Block 41: .gitignore file\\nAnd aProcfile file:\\nCode Block 42: Procfile file\\nYou also need to generate a requirements.txt file. You can do this with:\\nCode Block 43: Create new requirements.txt file\\nStep 4: Initialize Heroku, add files to Git, and Deploy. Prior to initializing Heroku, you need to install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) either with their installer available at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli or, on a Mac, using homebrew: brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku.\\nCode Block 44: Initialize Heroku and Deploy\\nYou should be able to view your app at https://my-dash-app.herokuapp.com (changing my-dash-app to the name of your app).\\nStep 5: Update the code and redeploy. When you modify any element of your app, you will need to add the changes to git and push those changes to Heroku. Also, whenever I change the underlying CSV data file, you need to push the new data set to Heroku.\\nCode Block 45: Pushing changes to Heroku via Git\\nI should note that if you have issues deploying to Heroku, try deploying a simply app first and test whether you are doing each step correctly. For instance, I found that I needed to add the following to the index.py file in order for the Heroku deployment to work: from app import server.\\nResolving an Issue with Custom.css File and Authentication\\nIn addition, I found that when I added authentication to my app, the app could no longer access my custom.css file, so I needed to create a css file on codepen.io and include it in the list of external css files (I am assuming that this is a bug in Dash).\\nDash Deployment Server\\nPlotly also offers a Dash Deployment Server …\\nfor easy app deployment in commercial IT environments, get started with support plans and workshops for mission critical projects, or contract our world-class engineering team for custom feature development or proof of concept app development.\\nI should note that I have no affiliation with Plotly.\\n15. Wrapping up\\nFrom start to finish, the project took about two and half weeks. I had not previously used Dash and had limited experience using Plotly. Some of the methods which I employed to build the dashboard included:\\nBuilding minimal parts of the dashboard first. Basically, I do not try to tackle everything at once. I built element at a time, and often by itself, before adding it to the entire dashboard.\\nTo ensure that I got my python syntax correct, I used a Jupyter notebook with the original data frame and applied each change in a piecewise fashion.\\nI would make small incremental changes to the app and then test. Rinse and repeat.\\nI developed one section first and got it working and to my liking. Then I would copy and paste this section to the other sections and make appropriate changes.\\nI saved deployment for the last step. I tested everything locally.\\nSome things on my wish list to update the Dashboard include:\\nAdd weeks to each graph axis, most likely using annotations.\\nHave the graph x-axis cross over years, rather than just depict either 2018 or 2019.\\nAdd a “print PDF” button for the report. I tried to implement one but haven’t been able to get it working yet.\\nAdd a footer with metadata (data sources, date data was pulled, where it was pulled from, etc.)\\nThanks for reading this far. I know it is a little overwhelming, but I essentially broke things down into manageable pieces.\",\n",
       " 'Why Model Explainability is The Next Data Science Superpower\\nMar 8, 2019 · 4 min read\\nModel explainability techniques show you what your model is learning, and seeing inside your model is even more useful than most people expect.\\nI’ve interviewed many data scientists in the last 10 years, and model explainability techniques are my favorite topic to distinguish the very best data scientists from the average.\\nSome people think machine learning models are black boxes, useful for making predictions but otherwise unintelligible; but the best data scientists know techniques to extract real-world insights from any model. For any given model, these data scientists can easily answer questions like\\nWhat features in the data did the model think are most important?\\nFor any single prediction from a model, how did each feature in the data affect that particular prediction\\nWhat interactions between features have the biggest effects on a model’s predictions\\nAnswering these questions is more broadly useful than many people realize. This inspired me to create Kaggle’s model explainability micro-course . Whether you learn the techniques from Kaggle or from a comprehensive resource like Elements of Statistical Learning , these techniques will totally change how you build, validate and deploy machine learning models.\\nWhy Are These Insights Valuable?\\nThe five most important applications of model insights are\\nDebugging\\nBuilding Trust\\nDebugging\\nThe world has a lot of unreliable, disorganized and generally dirty data. You add a potential source of errors as you write preprocessing code. Add in the potential for target leakage and it is the norm rather than the exception to have errors at some point in a real data science projects.\\nGiven the frequency and potentially disastrous consequences of bugs, debugging is one of the most valuable skills in data science. Understanding the patterns a model is finding will help you identify when those are at odds with your knowledge of the real world, and this is typically the first step in tracking down bugs.\\nInforming Feature Engineering\\nFeature engineering is usually the most effective way to improve model accuracy. Feature engineering usually involves repeatedly creating new features using transformations of your raw data or features you have previously created.\\nSometimes you can go through this process using nothing but intuition about the underlying topic. But you’ll need more direction when you have 100s of raw features or when you lack background knowledge about the topic you are working on.\\nA Kaggle competition to predict loan defaults gives an extreme example. This competition had 100s of raw features. For privacy reasons, the features had names like f1, f2, f3 rather than common English names. This simulated a scenario where you have little intuition about the raw data.\\nOne competitor found that the difference between two of the features, specifically f527 — f528, created a very powerful new feature. Models including that difference as a feature were far better than models without it. But how might you think of creating this variable when you start with hundreds of variables?\\nThe techniques you’ll learn in this course would make it transparent that f527 and f528 are important features, and that their role is tightly entangled. This will direct you to consider transformations of these two variables, and likely find the “golden feature” of f527 — f528.\\nAs an increasing number of datasets start with 100s or 1000s of raw features, this approach is becoming increasingly important.\\nDirecting Future Data Collection\\nYou have no control over datasets you download online. But many businesses and organizations using data science have opportunities to expand what types of data they collect. Collecting new types of data can be expensive or inconvenient, so they only want to do this if they know it will be worthwhile. Model-based insights give you a good understanding of the value of features you currently have, which will help you reason about what new values may be most helpful.\\nInforming Human Decision-Making\\nSome decisions are made automatically by models. Amazon doesn’t have humans (or elves) scurry to decide what to show you whenever you go to their website. But many important decisions are made by humans. For these decisions, insights can be more valuable than predictions.\\nBuilding Trust\\nMany people won’t assume they can trust your model for important decisions without verifying some basic facts. This is a smart precaution given the frequency of data errors. In practice, showing insights that fit their general understanding of the problem will help build trust, even among people with little deep knowledge of data science.',\n",

Your URL is straightforward, and you’re building some initial momentum.\\nBut, over time, your site grows more complex. In addition to considering upgrading and looking at different web hosting plans \\xa0(to support increases in users and traffic) you have more pages, posts, and URLs to deal with. You create pages and posts that no longer exist, or you decided to simplify the URL structure of your content.\\nMaybe you even purchased a domain name \\xa0you want to redirect to your site, or you want to switch domains altogether.\\nAs you can see, there are a lot of reasons you’ll need to redirect a website to another.\\nBelow you’ll learn what a website redirect is along with the most common scenarios then you’ll want to implement a website redirect.\\nWhat is a Website Redirect?\\nA website redirect will take one website URL and point it to another. When anyone types in or clicks on that original URL they’ll be taken to the new page or website.\\nEven if you don’t need to implement a redirect now, it’s probably something you’ll need to do eventually. Knowing how to implement a redirect will a valuable skill moving forward.\\nYou can implement redirects on a URL or page-by-page basis.\\nThere are a few different types of URL redirects you’ll want to be aware of. As you’ll see below, the 301 redirect is the most common and useful, but there are some other redirects available as well.\\n\\xa0\\n1. 301 Redirect\\nA 301 redirect is a permanent redirect. This is the most commonly used and powerful redirect as it passes on nearly all of the link juice of the existing domain. This type of redirect takes place on both a browser and server level. In time, the search engines will index this redirect.\\n\\xa0\\n2. 302 Redirect\\nA 302 redirect is used when you want to temporarily redirect a URL, but you have the intention of moving back to the old URL. For example, you’re redesigning your site, but want to direct users to a different domain while you finish building your site.\\n302 redirects aren’t used very often. If you’re considering using a 302 redirect, think carefully: you might be better off just utilizing a 301 redirect.\\n\\xa0\\n3. Meta Refresh\\nA meta refresh isn’t used very often. But, you’ve still probably seen this type of redirect before on page loading screens.\\nHave you ever landed on a page and been greeted with a message that says, “The original URL has moved, you’re now being redirected. Click here if you’re not redirected in 5 seconds”? Then you’ve experienced a meta refresh.\\nThis type of redirect does pass on a little link juice, but not as much as a 301 redirect.\\n\\xa0\\nReasons Why You’d Implement a Website Redirect\\nNow that you’re familiar with the types of redirects you can implement, it’s time to go into the reasons you’ll want to redirect a URL in the first place.\\nHere are some common scenarios where you’d want to redirect one website to another.\\n\\xa0\\n1. Redirect a Subdirectory to a Page on Your Site\\nMaybe when you created your site you decided to create your blog page on a subdomain of your site. So, instead of your blog URL being “mysite.com/blog”, it’s been “blog.mysite.com.”. Only now you’ve decided that it makes sense to switch your blog off of the original subdomain structure.\\nIn this case, you’ll want to implement a redirect.\\nThe same goes for any other reason you’ve created a site or section of your site on the subdomain, and now you want to switch up the URL structure.\\n\\xa0\\n2. Redirect Duplicate Content to the Original Page\\nHaving duplicate content across your site can really mess with your rankings . If you have a large site, then the chances are high you have some pages with duplicate content. When you have more than one version of the same page it makes it hard for Google to figure out which page to rank.\\nYou can avoid common duplicate content issues by redirecting the duplicate piece of content to the original. This will not only reduce confusion with your visitors, but it should improve your search engine rankings as well.\\n\\xa0\\n3. Redirect Multiple Domains to a Single Domain\\nIt’s common practice to buy up multiple domain names related to your main URL in order to protect your online brand.\\nBut, instead of just buying these domains and letting them sit there you can redirect them to your main website. Whether they’re common misspellings of your existing domain name, other top level domain name extensions, or something else entirely, they’re worth redirecting back to your main site.\\n\\xa0\\n4. Redirect Your Old Domain to Your New One\\nDid you originally build out your site on a domain that wasn’t your first choice, only to buy your dream domain later on?\\nIt happens more than you think. Maybe you went through a massive rebrand and changing your domain name was necessary.\\nWhatever the reason, you need to implement a redirect of your old domain to your new domain. Now, migrating an entire site is more intensive than a simple redirect, but it’s a good starting place.\\n\\xa0\\n5. Redirect an Old URL to a New URL\\nSometimes you’ll have to change the URL of existing pages and posts. Maybe you’re cleaning up your existing URL structure , or you moved some pages around and the old URL no longer makes sense.\\nIf this sounds like you, then you’ll want to implement a 301 redirect from the old URL to the new one. This is especially true if your older posts are already indexed in the search engines, or you have links out anywhere online.\\n\\xa0\\nConclusion\\nAs you can see, there are many reasons you’ll want to redirect a website, and a few different website redirects you can use. Hopefully, you have a better understanding of their value and why it’s something you’ll need to learn, eventually.\\n×',\n",

As a coronial inquiry would later find, Minchev was prescribed a range of legal narcotics by at least 31 doctors across 12 different medical centres in just one year.\\nSome GPs even referred to her as a “doctor shopper”, visiting multiple physicians to get multiple scripts to treat conditions including leg swelling, anxiety and depression. Yet, thanks in part to a medical system that encourages quick consultations and lacks the ability to monitor how drugs are dispensed, she was able to continue feeding her addiction.\\nIn 2013 this addiction killed her.

Today at least three people die from opioid harm in Australia a day, while 150 more are hospitalised.\\nAn investigation by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald has also found that the same companies that have been linked to - and are being sued over - the US crisis , including Purdue Pharma, are using similar marketing tactics to promote their products in Australia. But knowledge of the problem has had little effect on prescribing practices and governments are under growing pressure to act before it’s too late.\\n“Clearly,” says Australian Medical Association Victorian president Julian Rait, “to avoid going down the path of the Americans, we’ve got to lift our game.”\\nLuxury resorts and lobbyists\\nTo understand the rise of opioids in Australia, it’s instructive to look at the evolution of pain management globally.\\nOpioids attach to receptors in the brain, spinal cord and other parts of the body, reducing feelings of pain. But while they were once reserved for treating pain in cancer patients, those in palliative care and for “exceptional circumstances,” drug companies in the 1990s began to reframe the debate. They began pushing opioids as a safe and necessary way to treat chronic pain more broadly, from back problems and sports injuries to severe arthritis.\\nAdvertisement\\nAt the forefront of this shift was Purdue Pharma, the Connecticut-based company owned by one of America’s wealthiest families, the Sacklers.\\nIn the world of philanthropy, the Sackler name has pride of place at some of the world’s leading institutions. There’s the Sackler Museum at Harvard, the Sackler Gallery in Washington, the Sackler Wing at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. But this dynasty made its fortune from pharmaceuticals, in large part through Purdue Pharma’s signature product, Oxycontin, and the aggressive marketing campaign behind it.\\nA number of US lawsuits have revealed that sales representatives were deployed to convince doctors about the benefits of this groundbreaking new product, which Purdue claimed would be less addictive than other drugs. GPs were flown into luxury resorts to attend seminars about the need to treat pain more aggressively. Company-funded research was produced, along with sales videos, mugs and gimmick pens.\\nIt was a raging success. Sales grew from $48 million in 1996 to $1.1 billion just four years later. Now, though, Purdue Pharma is facing more than 2000 lawsuits seeking to hold the company accountable for the US opioid epidemic and the thousands of deaths that followed.\\nThe Sacklers come to town\\nJust two years after it started marketing Oxycontin in America, Purdue established an Australian arm, Mundipharma. The Age and Herald have established that eleven members of the Sackler family were among the Australian company’s original directors, and the family remained on the local board until 2012. Some have since been named as defendants in the US proceedings.\\nAdvertisement\\nMundipharma’s spokeswoman said that while the Sacklers sat as directors “they did not have an active day-to-day role in the management of Mundipharma’s business, which was led by a professional management team”.\\nBut when the Australian leg of the family company began its promotional campaign its approach was close to Purdue’s. Transparency reports filed with Medicines Australia shows Mundipharma holds production launch meetings over three-course dinners, sponsors conferences worth tens of thousands of dollars, and runs a “Pain Management Master Class” accredited by the Royal Australian College of Practitioners which almost 5000 medical professionals have taken.\\nPlay video\\nSupporters argue that events like these are a vital and legitimate way to educate doctors. If a patient wants to make sure their GP knows how to use the medicine prescribed, who better to tell you about it than the developer?\\nBut sometimes, the approach has been questionable. Last December, Mundipharma was forced to pay $302,400 in response to 24 infringement notices issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration over misleading advertising to doctors relating to one of its signature products, Targin.\\nAsked about its marketing strategies this week, the company said it strictly complies with Australian laws and regulations and supports “safe prescribing”.\\n“Opioid analgesics are appropriate for carefully selected patients such as patients with moderate to severe chronic pain,” a spokeswoman said.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Mundipharma is committed to providing the highest standard of accredited educational programs and quality resources for healthcare professionals, in response to their educational needs and in line with ensuring safe and appropriate prescribing of opioid-based treatments.”\\n\\'They\\'re awesome things, but ...\\'\\nAn estimated 3.24 million Australians suffer from chronic pain, but have limited options to manage it, particularly in rural and remote towns where pain specialists are rare. Appointments, for those lucky enough to get them, can cost hundreds of dollars. By comparison, a government subsidised pack of opioids will set you back about $6.\\nLoading\\nMany fear that tougher restrictions on prescription painkillers could have unintended consequences for those who genuinely need them just to get by. Two years ago, as the Therapeutic Goods Administration considered tighter regulations, consumers and pain specialists flooded the agency with written submissions warning it not to go too far.\\nOne person suffering with fibromyalgia - a condition marked by pain and muscle stiffness - put it like this: “If this were to happen I can see many chronic pain patients in similar predicaments to myself simply giving up and committing suicide.\\n“Chronic pain is not an easy thing to live with, and while some people abuse the system, most of us are trying everything in our power to help ourselves.”\\nAdvertisement\\nDenise \"Rustie\" Lassam says it\\'s about getting the balance right. As a teenager, she had an agonising spinal condition, which her doctors would treat using opioids and benzodiazepines. For the next 30 years she was hooked. At one point, she was taking nine 80 milligram tablets of oxycodone a day and between five and 15 Valium tablets. If she ran out of the drugs, she’d tell doctors she had lost her prescription in order to get another script, or hit the streets in search of a dealer selling Valium.\\n“I did so many things I’m not proud of,” Lassam says. “But addiction is insidious, and really cunning. Slowly but surely it takes over.”\\nDenise \\'Rustie\\' Lassam: addicted for 30 years.\\nCredit:Simon Schluter\\nWith the help of an addiction specialist, she has managed to kick the benzodiazepines and she\\'s on a methadone program that has significantly reduced her intake of opioids.\\n“It’s not about getting rid of them - they’re awesome things - and I certainly wouldn\\'t want to wake up from an operation and not have something assisting me to deal with what my body had been through, as that would be terrible,\" Lassam says. \"But having someone on Oxycontin four years after surgery, or 10 years after surgery? That is not on.”\\nThe \\'soft touch doctors\\'\\nAs the use of opioid pharmaceuticals increased in Australia, so too did concerns about the risks of crime and corruption. In Victoria, some paramedics were discovered to be siphoning vials of liquid fentanyl - which officers are meant to administer to injured patients as a quick form of pain relief. They were using the drug themselves and replacing it with saline.\\nIn Perth, a pharmacist stole staggering amounts of opioids from two major public hospitals, prompting an investigation by the anti-corruption watchdog. And in NSW a coronial inquiry heard stories about pensioners selling old fentanyl patches to drug users on the black market to help pay their bills.\\nFor every shocking headline, there were thousands more families whose lives had quietly been torn apart. Margaret and John Millington, who lost their son Simon 10 years ago, are among them.\\nSimon Millington was a country boy who embraced life. But on a winter night in 1994, a car accident on a quiet road in the western Victorian town of Nhill changed everything. When he was discharged from hospital, doctors gave him a kit bag of opioids to deal with the pain, sparking a devastating 16-year addiction. He died of an accidental overdose in 2010.\\nThe Millingtons made it their mission to push for reform. A few years ago, they were instrumental in securing an election commitment from both sides of politics to introduce real-time prescription monitoring in Victoria. This April, SafeScript, as it’s known, will become mandatory for all doctors and pharmacists in Victoria.\\n“We saw a system that was broken, and so many people were slipping through the cracks - including our son,” Margaret says.\\nUnder SafeScript, every time a doctor or pharmacist prescribes or dispenses opioids, benzodiazepines and other high-risk medicines, they will be required to record the information and check the patient’s records for any red flags. If a patient has earlier been “doctor shopping” for drugs at another clinic, alerts will appear. This should empower the doctor to talk to their patient.\\n“It provides quick, accurate, and valuable information about whether you should be prescribing something, whether you can do it safely, and what situation the person in front of you might be in,” says Dr Ines Rio, a doctor at the North Richmond Community Health Centre and chair of the Australian Medical Associations’s general practitioner section.\\nNick Carr, a GP at the St Kilda Medical Group agrees that medical professionals need something to equip them to deal with doctor shoppers. He’s run workshops teaching GPs to do just that for 20 years.\\n“Doctors are not very good at saying no,” says Carr. “They worry about things like: \\'Oh my God, what if the pain is genuine?\\' Or \\'what if their anxiety is so bad they have to have valium?\\'\"\\nDr Nick Carr.\\nCredit:Joe Armao\\nBut Carr also questions how Victoria\\'s mandatory system will be enforced, or whether doctors and patients could end up having “the dog ate my homework” arguments over supposedly lost prescriptions.\\nAnd then there\\'s the big problem: the lack of national consistency.\\nIn 2017, Health Minister Greg Hunt committed $16 million towards the roll-out of an Australia-wide tracking system, putting in place the necessary infrastructure so that states and territories could share their data.\\nLoading\\nThe trouble is, they\\'re yet to connect. Some jurisdictions like Victoria have gone it alone, while others have made little progress, including NSW, even though it has the highest rate of opioid-related deaths in the country.\\nSome important changes have been made. In 2018, the federal government made codeine available by prescription only, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration has this year sought to introduce smaller packages for immediate-release opioid products as well as further restrictions on fentanyl patches. But without an interconnected system, people could potentially go doctor shopping interstate.\\nSimon Millington used to do just that, says Margaret, driving from his home in western Victoria to NSW and South Australia, determined to get his next fix.\\n“They know who the \\'soft touch\\' doctors are,” she says.\\n“That’s why it’s so important for other states to sign up. It will save lives.”\\nKnow more? Contact Farrah Tomazin on ftomazin@theage.com.au\\nLifeline 13 11 14',\n",

       " 'Devin Coldewey @techcrunch / 5 days\\nThe cameras on our phones are getting good enough that it’s becoming hard to justify having a dedicated picture-taking device. Fujifilm’s X100 series has always made one of the strongest cases for it, however, and the latest iteration makes it more convincing than ever.\\nI reviewed the original X100 back in 2011 , and the series has received a new model about every two years since its announcement ; today’s X100V is the fifth. But its changes are more significant than those of any one of its predecessors.\\nThe X100V has a new 24-megapixel APS-C sensor and image processor, taken from Fuji’s high-end X-Pro3, which I’ve used and been quite impressed with. It also inherits the X-Pro3’s much-improved OLED/optical viewfinder, autofocus system and other features. But they’re married to a redesigned 35mm equivalent, F/2 lens that improves on what was already excellent glass.\\nThe series has always had a throwback aesthetic, adding dials while others eliminated them, but in a concession to modernity the rear LCD is now a tilting touchscreen, now a must-have for many shooters. It also has improved video capabilities, and is now weatherproofed as well.\\nPlus, it’s beautiful.\\nAll these fit into a package that is highly compact and attractive, though admittedly considerably thicker than a phone. But although under some circumstances a phone camera can indeed rival a dedicated camera, the X100V perhaps more than any other compact camera justifies itself (incidentally, DPReview’s initial impressions are highly favorable).\\nThe shooting experience is so different (the hybrid viewfinder is and always has been genius), it puts so many options at your disposal, and the resulting image will not only be superior, but more defined by what you want to create than what your phone is capable of doing.\\nI’ve been trying to reconnect with photography and I’ve found that relying on the phone for that simply isn’t an option for me any more. I want the right tool for the job, yet I don’t want to be inconvenienced by a camera’s size or operation, or obsess over my lens selection. I want an image-taking device as dedicated to that purpose as a knife is to cutting.\\nIs that the X100V? There is real competition from Ricoh’s latest GR III street shooter, as well as the Canon G5 X II and Sony’s RX100 VII. Although camera sales are dropping, there’s no better time to want or have a compact device in this class. Fortunately it seems to come down to personal preference. I’d be happy with any one of those in my hand, if it means I can leave my phone in my pocket.',\n",
       " 'Automatic Machine Learning: Learning How to Learn\\nJan 22, 2019 · 2 min read\\nAlphaD3M, a new AutoML model, reduces computation time from hours to minutes\\nIddo Drori, CDS Adjunct Associate Professor, Kyunghyun Cho, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Data Science, Claudio Silva and Juliana Freire, Professors of Data Science, Computer Science, and Engineering, Remi Rampin, CDS Research Engineer, and Yamuna Krishnamurthy, Raoni de Paula Lourenco, Jorge Piazentin, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, contributed to the recent paper, AlphaD3M: Machine Learning Pipeline Synthesis .\\nThe paper introduces AlphaD3M, an automatic machine learning (AutoML) system whose objective is to learn how to learn via self-play. The “D3M” in AlphaD3M’s name comes from DARPA’s Data Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program, which has propelled machine learning toward solving any user-specified task, given any dataset. This goes beyond the traditional vision, in which AutoML solved a task given a dataset, a well-defined task, and performance criteria.\\nAlphaZero, Alphabet’s DeepMind-produced system that taught itself chess, inspired the design of AlphaD3M’s system. AlphaD3M, like AlphaZero, uses a single-player pipeline synthesis model. Instead of AlphaZero’s single operation, “move,” AlphaD3M offers the player three actions (insertion, deletion, and replacement) to synthesize a working pipeline. The model utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM). The network takes training examples as inputs, and outputs probabilities and an approximation of pipeline performance.\\nThe researchers note the benefits of their approach to the pipeline model, which include easy explanation of the working pipeline because of the simple edit operations used to obtain it. The pipeline model uses deep reinforcement learning through self-play, and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, along with the RNN. These components provide the system with the functionality to project solutions and learn patterns.\\nBecause the researchers represented the metadata and pipeline chain as “state,” their model can be viewed as an entire board game configuration. AlphaD3M performed competitively when compared against state-of-the-art AutoML methods including Autosklean, TPOT, and Autostacker. Researchers concluded that AlphaD3M, whose neural network takes advantage of GPUs, is a full order of magnitude faster than existing AutoML methods, decreasing computation time from hours to minutes. AlphaD3M also outperforms SGD, the baseline pipeline, in 75% of datasets. In only 7% of cases does AlphaD3M perform worse than SGD.\\nBy Sabrina de Silva',\n",
       " '4 Must Have Skills Every Data Scientist Should Learn\\nBy Ben Rogojan\\nWe wanted to follow up our previous piece about how to grow as a data scientist with some other skills senior data scientists should have. Our hope is to bridge the gap between business managers and technical data scientists by creating clear goals senior data scientists can aim for. Both entities have to take on very different problems. Both benefit when they are on the same page. This is why the previous post focused so highly on communication. It seems simple, but the gap between technical and business continues to grow as new technologies keep getting piled on every year. Thus, we find it important that managers and data scientists have a clear path of expectations.\\nBoth business and IT knowledge are very specialized. However, due to this specialization of skills, most businesses see a gap between the two specializations. Our role is to help fill it!\\nWe find that is beneficial when data scientists are starting their journey that they focus heavily on the technical aspects. This means programming, queries, data cleansing, etc. However, as data scientists grow. They need to focus more on design decisions and communication with management. This will multiply the impact of the more experienced data scientists knowledge. Instead of being stuck in the day to day of coding. They can make higher level decisions and help the younger data scientists if they get stuck. More experienced data scientists benefit both themselves and their companies more when they are utilizing their experience to help make design decisions that simplify complex systems, optimize data flows, and help make decisions on what projects are most pertinent.\\nBeing Able To Simplify The Complex\\nData scientists have a tendency to want to use every technique and algorithm they know on every problem and in every solution. In turn, this creates complex systems that are difficult to maintain.\\nData science does require complex and abstract modeling as well as plethora of complex technologies (from Hadoop to Tensorflow ). With all the complexity that surrounds the field, it is tempting to develop systems and algorithms that are in turn complex. There is the temptation to involve 4 or 5 different technologies and utilize every new hot algorithm or framework. However, like most other fields that have some engineering involved. Reducing complexity is often better for multiple reasons.\\nIf If John von Neumann , Erwin Schrödinger and Albert Einstein can help us understand the complexities of their very math and physics driven fields, then we data scientists can’t hide behind complexity., Erwin Schrödinger and Albert Einstein can help us understand the complexities of their very math and physics driven fields, then we data scientists can’t hide behind complexity.\\nThe role of an engineer is to simplify a task. If you have ever built or seen a Rube Goldberg machine you will understand the idea of over engineering a simple task. Some data scientists algorithms and data systems would look more like some crazy mouse trap held together by duct tape and gum instead of an elegant but effective solution. Making simpler systems means the systems will be easier to maintain over time as well as provide future data scientists the ability to add and take away modules as needed. The next data scientist taking your position will thank you if you create a simple framework. On the other hand, if you use 3 different languages, 2 data sources, 10 algorithms and leave no documentation, then just know the future engineer is cursing your name under his breath.\\nSimple algorithms and systems also allow for easier additions and subtractions to be made. Thus, as technology changes and updates are required or a module needs to be taken out. A poor future data scientist isn’t stuck with playing a game of Jenga with your code. If I remove this block of code, will everything fall apart(have you heard of technical debt ?)\\nKnowing How To Mesh Data Without Primary Keys\\nOne of the big values strong data experts should provide is tying together data sets that might not inherently have a primary or obvious connection. Data can represent a person or business’s day to day interactions. Having the ability to find statistical patterns in this data is what allows data scientists the ability to help decision makers make wise choices. However, the data you would like to mesh together is not always on the same system or the same granularity.\\nThose who have worked with data will know it is not always integrated together nicely in one database. Finance data is often kept separate from IT Service Management data, and outside data sources might not have the same level of aggregation. This is a problem because to find value in data sometimes requires data from other departments and systems.\\nData meshing requires building pieces at the same level of granularity. One way to think of it is having one large puzzle piece being joined together by another large piece created by lots of smaller puzzle pieces of data.\\nFor example, what if you are provided medical claims, credit card and criminal rates of neighborhoods and want to figure out how these socio-economic factors affect the patient?. Some sets of data might be on a person by person level while the others might be on a street or city level with no clear method to connect the the data sets. What is the best way to proceed? This becomes a design issue that one, must be recorded and two must be thought out.\\nEach situation is different as there are many ways to mesh data. It could be based of region, traits, spending habits, etc. This is why experience is important. An experienced data scientist will have the intuition on how the data can be joined. Mostly because they have already tried hundreds of methods that don’t work. Often times, the closer you can combine both data sets to person by person the better. So if region or city happens to be the lowest level (Lowest level refers to granularity of the data, like person level, household level, street level, city level, state level, or many other groupings ) of connection, then that would be a great place to start.\\nBeing Able To Prioritize Projects\\nAs a data scientist, you have to know how to explain the ROI of projects that might not turn out. This is just about good direct communication(Our team will never stop talking about communication). This is about being able to articulate value as well as prioritize long term vs short term goals(again, easier said than done).\\nTeams will always have more projects and project requests than they can handle. More experienced team members need to take the lead and help their managers decide which projects are actually worth taking on. There is a fine balance between quick projects that might not have the highest ROI but have a good chance of succeeding and long term projects that are more likely to fail but also provide a large ROI.\\nIn this case it is good to have a decision matrix of sorts to help simplify the process.\\nOne of the classical decision matrices for projects is a 2 by 2 matrix that is importance and urgency. This matrix can be found in most business courses at college and it is really simple. That is why it is great!\\nI have worked at companies with really smart people. Yet, every project was treated as a priority and if you haven’t heard the saying, we will say it here.\\nIf everything is a priority then nothing is.\\nChoosing the right projects requires making had calls. Not everything is a priority.\\nMany other companies have this problem. This is why it is important for the experienced members of the data science teams to be to clearly articulate which projects really should be done now, vs later. Thus, using the simple matrix will do that.\\n(Like we said in our last post, being concise is important. Using the matrix to help specify ROI will help).\\nWhen there is concise and straightforward communication, projects continue to move forward and trust is built.\\nBeing Able To Develop Robust And Optimal Systems\\nMaking an algorithm or model that operates in a controlled environment is one thing. Integrating a robust model into a system that is live and deals with massive amounts of data is a whole other thing. Depending on the company, sometimes the data scientist will just have to develop the algorithm itself. Then either a developer or machine learning engineer will be responsible for putting it into production.\\nHowever, this is not always the case. Smaller companies, and smaller teams might have the data science team put the code into production. This means the algorithm needs to be able to manage the data traffic at a reasonable speed. If your algorithm takes 3 hours to run and needs to be accessed live. It is not going into production. Thus, good system design and optimization is necessary.\\nAs data grows, and more and more people interact with a system. It is important your model keeps up.\\nData science is complex field that requires an understanding of data, statistics, programming, and subject matters. In order to grow, data scientists need to be able to simplify and distill these complexities into algorithms. They need to be able to focus more on making design decisions. This helps maximize their knowledge and experience that they have.\\nSummary\\nSenior data experts provide the largest impact for both themselves and their companies when they go beyond their technical abilities. The value they bring to the table is their experience, it can help guide younger developers to make better design decisions, and help managers make better decisions on which projects will have the best ROI. In turn, this magnifies the impact of their involvement on the team.']"

    "# 5 NLP - Encode the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to convert the corpus into bag-of-words representation. This means that each of the word in the text will be uniquely counted, and be saved as a term-document matrix. A __term-document matrix__ is where each of the unique words will have its individual coloumn and its count as the row data. Each text document is then assigned a row. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset will be full of features, where with the words individually counted, and the multiple columns of words. It should also be noted that within the text, there are words called __'stop words'__ where generally, these are very common and will provide no content regarding each article/text data. These should be removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "After removing the stop words, there are further considerations such as plurals, for example, dog and dogs. Originally, these would be considered as 2 separate words. This can be consolidated by using __stemming or lemmatisation__. This will then reduce the number of features further, but ensures that they are useful. It should also be noted that this method does consolidate past tensed of a word as well. Stemming on the other hand will create pseudo-words instead of its base form, where for example, pennies would become penni. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next is to utilise the __term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)__ algorithm to filter the data and enchance the unique words within the dataset. This algorithm will calculate ratio for each of the word terms within the matrix. for more information: http://www.tfidf.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall:\n",
    "1. Transform the text data into term-document matrix.\n",
