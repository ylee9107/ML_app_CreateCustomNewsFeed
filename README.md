# ML App to Create a Custom Newsfeed

## Introduction:

Reading is an excellent way to fill in any knowledge gap. It is even better if there is a way to enchance this experience whereby to quickly get a customised newsfeed tailored to the reader's interests. This project/app aims to help frequent readers such as myself to find even more to read or rather, to satisfy curiousities on certain topics. It can be seen as beneficial to have what you want to read without going through the hassle of digging for it. 

Hopefully by the end of this project, a system can be built that is able to understand a tailored taste in news and be able to send them directly to the user.

## Breakdown of the Project:
- Making a supervised training set with the Pocket App.
- Utilising the Pocket API to obtain stories.
- Making use of the Embedly API to extract story bodies.
